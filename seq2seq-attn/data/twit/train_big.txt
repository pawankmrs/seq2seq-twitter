639172320771375104	nintendo	positive	@SapphireGamma @StarlightAurora Sorry, had to go home. Nintendo's priority with the NX should be having a good 1st-party launch lineup.

639798156079665154	nintendo	positive	On 2nd thought, the NX rumors don't completely make sense because Nintendo is already planning smartphone games
639921099166339072	nintendo	positive	@jrconway3 @BitnerdGX Sure, it may not be in a direct sense. But Nintendo gives GX the support by sending them coverage and press releases.
640012708411129856	nintendo	negative	I admit Nintendo may have gone a bit overboard with the whole "lets give all the popular youtubers a copy of super mario maker" thing
640082944564965380	nintendo	negative	@xchadillacx it comes out NOV 13 if it does come out. Nintendo is notorious for rumors trust me ha

640411153911287808	nintendo	negative	There is a certain cult classic game, the 3rd in its series, that we have been waiting for in the US but Nintendo refuses to release it
640451835057143808	nintendo	positive	Honestly, lack of 3rd party support should have been expected. its not the company's fault for not siding with Nintendo
640523838321725444	nintendo	positive	@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
640624064198017024	nintendo	positive	@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol
640688164588363776	nintendo	positive	@16KTS @Flareonys Nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.

641295492492738560	nintendo	positive	@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
641296016788996096	nintendo	positive	It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy
641296390883291136	nintendo	positive	Apparently Super Mario Maker comes out on the 11th of September. I guess it's Nintendo's way of saying "just bloody rebuild them already".
641330259644784642	nintendo	positive	What if tomorrow Apple is just like, "the Apple TV is now a game console and we're going to take on Sony and Microsoft (and Nintendo)" lol.

665776665843400704	dana white	negative	Biggest problem with UFC is that Dana White seems to feed sheep to lions for ticket sales. It's not exactly fixed but it may as well be.
665078664359374852	dana white	negative	Dana White &amp; Joe Silva are scum bag atheists and Ronda Rousey is endorsing Bernie Sanders. Don't give them your money. Stream the UFC on Sat

632237370314784768	dustin johnson	negative	@Chris__Shield @kizrees at least Dustin Johnson knows how to party which is why I'm guessing he falls apart by Sunday after his weekend out
622972681797902336	dustin johnson	negative	@KellyTilghmanGC After the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that Dustin Johnson was in a class of his own. Same old garbage.
622843555069960192	dustin johnson	negative	After 75 today maybe I was wrong about Dustin Johnson getting over US Open collapse. Terrible 3rd RD #OpenChampionship
632057945908379657	dustin johnson	negative	Also, I see Dustin Johnson is leading after the 1st round of a major again. So he's gonna choke on the weekend again? #boring

636475722593386496	kane	negative	#mufc really need to sort their shit out! No defenders &amp; attackers! Stones &amp; berahino or Kane, may not be the best yet but would take them
636717170089570304	kane	negative	1st they're trying Kane &amp; now Derrick Rose. Yeah, OK. I call bullshit. Lie detector tests should be mandatory when it comes to rape charges.
637670724317134848	kane	negative	2nd season epl syndrome would have been worse on kane if he left spurs. Let him suffer it there then improve later
635917392397385729	kane	negative	@Aviator973 @ByTimGraham Agree with 1st point, and I can't stand Kane or Blackhaws. I detest slander.

637717461480177664	kane	negative	@ironviews Good article, and good point about Sakho. He could be sat here now in the same situation as Kane, with people starting to doubt.
637760669698392064	kane	negative	Didn't it take Kane until, like, November to score his first PL goal last season?
640122053379682304	kane	negative	Hawks might have had decision made for them. With Kane case going before grand jury, no way he can be in camp on the 17th, IMO. #NHL
641319702615228416	kane	negative	I am hearing a settlement may be in the works with Kane and alleged victim. He might be pulling a Kobe - WHICH MEANS HE IS GUILTY!!
638803384032718848	kane	negative	I've been thinking about it... Does anyone else find it disturbing how Kane may face rape charges and GM's are calling on his availability?
638757527237226496	kane	negative	Kane may have raped a woman &amp; the 1st thought teams have is about trading for him? Fucked up. http://t.co/4mB4QYQKKU http://t.co/i1uXbk36y7
635093648368082944	kane	negative	Kane might just be going thru that 2nd season syndrome
638813565865054208	kane	negative	No way Kane comes here, it's where he gets in trouble the most. Would be kicked out of the NHL by his 30th bday for summer incidents
638219490690359296	kane	negative	Real shit vote Kanye for president if he really is doing it , can't stand Donald trump and Kane's my 2nd dad
637694607782989828	kane	negative	Same old same old good till the last 3rd no support for Kane no width fuck knows what Poch is doing ain't got a fucking clue
639402684202790912	kane	negative	Spurs may aswell make use of adebayor,there paying him millions and there guna need someone when they realise Kane is a one season wonder

638549633237651457	kane	negative	Would never vote for Kane for president, mostly with Kim Kardashian as his wife. No way in hell is she going to be the 1st lady
640989094219239424	kane	negative	and FYI, I never had a HUGE problem with Kane; I just don't have respect for anyone who may of raped someone.
640220744711032832	kane	positive	6-0. Shelvey stakes a claim, Delph impressive too and Kane back in the goals in some style. Sets Tuesday up very nicely. ML #BO66Y #England
635888316878094340	kane	positive	@AdamOsper @JustinTHFC84 @timabel6 @Paulhitsheet Levy left us short last season but Kane saved our season. This time you may see us drift.
635634210523455488	kane	positive	@Allie_Davison Team Undertaker right here. Thinking we may see Kane tonight though.
635041493221265408	kane	positive	@AxAs23 Shaw, Sterling, Ox and Kane may have a chance of being top class in the near future
637679344731553792	kane	positive	@BrendanWadlow still see Koivu. You even admitted it was a good comparison like a month back. Kane may be a better one though.
636550553439375360	kane	positive	@Corrienationstr I agree with you, because Kane is much cheaper and Bale though a fee is agreeable, he may not want to come.
635275702766542849	kane	positive	@JeffGordonWeb U gotta get in front of Kane he's 1st one a lap down!
638395106651959297	kane	positive	@KaneAndEriksen @EASPORTSFIFA we adore Kane for being 2nd top scorer , he was 2nd top assister
639302918416527360	kane	positive	@LethalLaserKJ lol jk, Kane is too valuable. Teams would have to give up 1st liners for him. Dude was 2nd in scoring on the team.
639101544097382400	kane	positive	@PeteSchaad @footysoldiers and he was 4th top scorer in Prem last yr after Kun, Kane and Costa honestly surprised no one signed him #vhappy!
641557939321499648	kane	positive	@Sirled26 Indeed, hopefully Kane's England success gives his season kick-start it needed. 3 points absolutely vital on Sunday, nothing less.
640821210041835520	kane	positive	@THNMattLarkin Kane, Karlsson, Getzlaf, Couture available for my 1st pick. Who would you take? I want Forsberg and/or Buff.

637698511870533633	kane	positive	@Wonder_Spurs going by the last 3 games yes.I think son may bring last season Kane back.He under to much pressure .We expect to much of him
635105467841118208	kane	positive	@adampeacock3 @TheRealBozza @RobbieSlater17 Kane's best service in the 1st half came from the keeper! Says it all
639068316833873920	kane	positive	@ahmed_muz No, don't think he's ready yet. With Kane, N'Jie, Son, Chadli &amp; Lamela we have enough options till Jan + Ade in case of emergency
639287257480847362	kane	positive	@brewingwins "No!" Am I outa the loop somewhere? This is the 2nd time today I've heard Kane &amp; AZ in same breath.

635194114699599872	kane	positive	@gary302 agreed. Pay 30mill for Kane now or watch him bag 20+ and pay 50 mill in Jan ? The other 2 are going nowhere.
635356817829134336	kane	positive	@kanechoa Hi, Kane. We're sorry for the inconvenience. May we please have your ticket number and e-mail address via DM? Thank you.
640650640046354436	kane	positive	@nurfgunjake fingers crossed you see kane tomorrow got to meet up with your boyf
636672225454768130	kane	positive	@robbieJBhood Kane walked off with a tight calf last saturday. If he starts i guess N'jie will be on the bench.
635487568113598469	kane	positive	@thfc53 Lol. Does he seem like a Poch type of player? Or one that would fit in our wage structure? Or play 2nd fiddle to Kane? No.
637671393631576064	kane	positive	A mong he may be, but if Kane can produce last seasons form consistently then England have a goal scorer for 10+ years

638610739884900352	nicki	negative	@MileyCyrus I dreamed about katy perry dragging Nicki's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal. I hope it's gonna happen
638426362014003200	nicki	negative	@Nicki_F @ThalesLives @scottedelman You may disagree Nicki, but the facts just don't support you. Nor does the vote by all of fandom.
638467839867813888	nicki	negative	@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...
638213295313453056	nicki	negative	@itsbl0ndie I still think it was fake. I always thought Nicki to be the type to call you out on a random Tuesday, not at an awards show
639148386432647168	nicki	negative	@musicnews_shade azealia may not be the most famous rapper of all time but sadly, nicki's songs are in billboard for her physique not talent
638200075571851264	nicki	negative	@nice_feminist she may be a """"problematic fave"""" but there's NO reason for her to be getting dragged just cuz Nicki said some shit
638543287457050624	nicki	negative	@rayshellbox Kasi nga diba may prejudice pa rin about black entertainers? Also Miley says that Nicki keeps pulling the race card--
638217378417917952	nicki	negative	@spectralpixie nicki can't even get her 3rd album to go gold lmfao Nicki copies off Kim's OLD shit, Kim was the first female with --
638187719433154560	nicki	negative	A no no, Kanye announces he's running for president, and nicki gets crazy with Miley all in the the same night.. It's Sunday wtf
641368923536015361	nicki	negative	A woman called Nicki a wee bitch and spat because she sat down in front of her on the 11
638562517573369856	nicki	negative	All Nicki said was "what's good" like c'mon now we get it she a bad bitch ok
638215640306839552	nicki	negative	And tomorrow Nicki is going to be seen as "a raging angry black women" for calling Miley out of something that she is GUILTY for
638238764238659584	nicki	negative	Do you guys remember that not too long ago Nicki was like one of the most hated artist.. During her Pink Friday album
638400941306327040	nicki	negative	I think Nicki made an ass out of herself last night. 1st you call the VMA's racist, 2nd then you perform and accept an award at the VMA's
638181134413656064	nicki	negative	I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus
639149015481864192	nicki	negative	If Nicki didn't have her ass, she'd be shorter when she sat down.
638193301951238144	nicki	negative	If you think Nicki's ass is more than 1/8th real you are fuuucked
638181130026512384	nicki	negative	Kanye and Nicki are the reason they may have to do away with award shows. YOU say it's about artists but you two always make it about YOU.
638163651766038528	nicki	negative	Literally 1st time I've ever watched the #VMAs. Miley called Nicki out on her CRAP, and I respect that. #sorrynotsorry #suckitupnicki
638190899210657792	nicki	negative	Lost some respect for Nicki after that. You may be a queen in the rap world but when u start shit at an award show u look like garbage #VMAs
638868043385466880	nicki	negative	Miley has no tits &amp; ass but Kim and Nicki may have the same botox injection expert and Kim ain't got shit to lose. https://t.co/EEjrWcrHzw
639172957089103872	nicki	negative	Miley is the 8th most hated person in America, idk why y'all are acting like Nicki gets more hate than Miley

638203967588073472	nicki	negative	Why is Nicki always calling someone out on stage .. Bitch looks so trashy while Miley just sat there and took what she said with class
638189825636593664	nicki	negative	Yall act like Nicki really Finna mess up Taylor's moment ............for the 2nd time again. #VMAs
638443185048522752	nicki	negative	i want mildew clitoris off my tl i dont want her anywhere near nicki i dont want to see her rat ass ever again launch her into the sun
638224558311387138	nicki	negative	i'm tweeting this for the 2nd time, nicki needs to realize that people don't buy her music NOT BECAUSE SHE ISN'T "SKINNY AND WHITE"+
638175160839700480	nicki	negative	miley.. you better watch out for nicki backstage she may throw hands

638164629122715649	nicki	positive	@Iovemyths Watch: even tho that was Nicki responding 2 Miley putting her on blast 1st the media will make it out like Nicki picking a fight.
641105517432205313	nicki	positive	@Likeitornotmama @LILKIMQOR Its not... Nicki garnered the success she has today because of what her 2nd album entailed AND the look.
639576438224605184	nicki	positive	@Likeitornotmama @jda927 Lil Kim will be remembered as the 3rd/4th most successful female rapper. Nicki will/is the 1st. Numbers don't lie.
639098554443780096	nicki	positive	@LuxxSOCIAL @Raheem_TM it may have have gotten a higher score never denied that fact....but Nicki's album is STILL critically acclaimed. Lol

639962498309996544	nicki	positive	@TeaMasterT People need to full-stop stop using that for White characters. Full-stop. It's EXACTLY what Nicki criticized in the 1st place.
638405130912727041	nicki	positive	@ZeusBarker true, but she was flapping her gums, I'm glad Nicki sat her down. Someone needed to show her what she said was foul.

628692087928680448	sharknado	negative	'There's no point to Sharknado, they may as well as had Slothnado. Sloths killing ppl with their hooks'
624040285496971264	sharknado	negative	@Ike58Reese or just watch something more meaningful than Sharknado!! Cmon man! May i suggest @neiltyson 's #cosmos - feed your brain yo
624072923096215553	sharknado	negative	@MattFossen @FrankConniff 1st, they did do Plan 9. 2nd, Sharknado is not earnestly bad, it's ironically so. That's why MST3K wouldn't work
624048464360443904	sharknado	negative	@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one. Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too. XD it's horrible that it's hilarious. This is a really bad movie.
624085606730067968	sharknado	negative	A 60 mile flame burning hotter than the surface of the sun!?! Come on Sharknado, that is even ridiculous for you.
623628200287928321	sharknado	negative	All you people watching Sharknado tomorrow are they terrorists hate us.
624015729394847744	sharknado	negative	How did Sharknado get a 3rd film? How did Sharknado even get a film to begin with? Life doesn't make much sense.
624077263168868356	sharknado	negative	I am not in the right frame of mind to attempt to watch Sharknado 3 yet. I may need to start drinking.
623629948209786880	sharknado	negative	I can't believe people really like Sharknado enough for them to make a 3rd part. So stupid.
624043810041917441	sharknado	negative	I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh
624046648583430144	sharknado	negative	I dont understand the obsession with Sharknado.... watched the first two and they sucked. Im sure the 3rd one is just as bad.
623928486059708416	sharknado	negative	I figured Sharknado was played out at #2 &amp; tonight we get #3? I won't be watching, just like the 1st 2
624351544360615937	sharknado	negative	I hate the Sharknado fandom. It's a poor imitation of so bad it's good. Also I don't care if April lives #suckmynado
640206463575588864	sharknado	negative	I sat through the whole of Sharknado 2 I'm pretty sure NS is nothing compared to that shit.
625406860410101760	sharknado	negative	I think Sharknado 3 may have jumped the shark, and gone too far down the make a bad movie road. The second half is just awful in a bad way.
624053389979222018	sharknado	negative	I'm convinced listening to the Freak Show tomorrow morning will be WAY better than that Sharknado ending. @fsmikey @FSBigBob
624431022713778180	sharknado	negative	It may be significant to some of those who enjoy movies with a cult following but Sharknado is a disgrace to the film industry
624304836050194432	sharknado	negative	It sucks we live in a world where Sharknado is about to start a 4th sequel but we can't get a Tron 3 or Dredd 2.
627432973306978304	sharknado	negative	Just starting to watch Sharknado 4 the 1st time. Craptacular already. Cc @beerlytweeting @hadyngreen
624443681806884864	sharknado	negative	Okay the first Sharknado was funny but do we really need a 4th movie? I think I lost a few brain cells after watching the 3rd
623984383691591680	sharknado	negative	Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No, is that the movies title or just everyone's reaction when they heard a 3rd one was being churned out?
623910234000494592	sharknado	negative	Sharknado 3 comes on tonight. Yes, a movie about a shark tornado has made it to a 3rd movie, and yes, I too have lost all faith in humanity.
624039042368278528	sharknado	negative	Sharknado 3 may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.
624388359624916992	sharknado	negative	Sharknado 3 may have overdone it just a little bit. And that's saying something for a Sharknado movie.
638418573040451585	sharknado	negative	Sharknado is definitely the best of the worst. Come see the spectacle this Thursday at 6 &amp;9pm in the RH Theatre! http://t.co/lfOjKxaM9q
632704212598591488	sharknado	negative	Sharknado is one of the worst movies in existence, but I'm watching it for the 10th time for some unknown reason
624037599213187072	sharknado	negative	Sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced I cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, I saw sharks flying n had to call it a day
624779858984476673	sharknado	negative	Sharknado may be the worst movie ever created
624053102371450880	sharknado	negative	Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen.
624040969915252736	sharknado	negative	Sharknado was funny the first time. We humored them for the 2nd. But a THIRD? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
623692890154340352	sharknado	negative	Shout out to @ZombeaversMovie for being the worst movie since @SharknadoSyfy... Sharknado has a chance to reclaim the title tomorrow...
637465216469606404	sharknado	negative	The 1st Sharknado was good, the 2nd bad and the 3rd was just pathetic. They are making a 4th, but I'm done with them now! #sharknado
624074448509898752	sharknado	negative	The Great Wall of Sharknado, the 9th Wonder of the World. Oh, HELL NO! #Sharknado3
626204382342836224	sharknado	negative	The Zoo miniseries may be the worst collection of images &amp; sounds man has ever produced. We're talking Sharknado w/o the self-awareness.
624184179232649216	sharknado	negative	The fact that there is a 3rd Sharknado is everything that is wrong with this world... Lamer than my #LameJoke collection... #Sharknado3
624025749058551808	sharknado	negative	Unfollowing anyone tweeting about Sharknado, may god have mercy on yr soul
624123909802213376	sharknado	negative	Who knew there were enough people in the world easily pleased by shite like Sharknado that they're getting a 4th instalment?!
626362268461232129	sharknado	negative	Why does someone make the effort to produce a 3rd movie of Sharknado anyways lmao
624040558701342720	sharknado	negative	may i just say the lighting in Sharknado 3 could use a little work?????

624028257986293760	sharknado	positive	Cost of running the 1st advertisement in Sharknado 3 probably rivals the Super Bowl. Nice play there, @hotelsdotcom.

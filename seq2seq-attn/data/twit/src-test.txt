Sorry gang, 2nd Act of Ant-Man just kills my buzz. SO BORING and the writing is REALLY bad. I'm hoping this stuff wasn't in Wright's script.
The only reason I'm watching Ant-Man is cause of 5$ Tuesday this is definitely something you wait to watch at home

@FabrecIass I had high expectactions when I watched because everyone was hyping it so much, I knew Ant-Man would be good after 1st trailer
@HeroesInColor00 you definitely aren't, Ant-Man was my 2nd favorite Phase 2 flick right after Winter Soldier
@ItsNotAStar Took my son to see Ant-Man yesterday and the #ForceAwakens trailer played before. 1st time seeing it on big screen. #AWESOME
@Jacksters26 Probably see Ant-Man at the cinema tomorrow. ) I hope you enjoy your tea, I'm certain you will. x
@JayCyde There are a few winks in WINTER SOLDIER and ANT-MAN, various IRON MANs. Largely, though, you may be right.
@NinDorkKnight @SpinelessOyster I am so hyped for tomorrow, the clip at the end of Ant-Man was enough to get me excited
@ReesMarshall1 They are great aren't they - I have one from the Ant-Man wave coming tomorrow as I want to build the Ultron figure.
@Rivulet027 Yeah, Ant-man fails on Jan and her daughter, but it's still a better movie than FF according to reviewers I trust.
@RottenTomatoes Horrible. Diehard fans may love the hard R, but lots of people will pass. Ant-Man was fun, quirky, enjoyable. Not this.
@Sartorial_Kai @LordXReshead  Na if they know wa good for them it will be like Ant-man, Mar-Vell would give Carol Danvers the mantle
@SlyBibliomaniac yeah, on Friday I went and saw two movies people bitch about - Ant-Man and Minions. I had a good time! #HatersGonnaHate
@ThePaddyMcB Fair enough. Unrelated, think I may go see Ant-Man again tomorrow if you're interested.
@The_Xzav I'm gonna see Ant-man tomorrow, can't wait. (you seeeee, I'm doing theaters lol)

Ant-Man at AMC Cinema Suites on a Sunday afternoon is a great choice. Good film. Have to see it again cause missed @HayleyAtwell's scene
Ant-Man feels like a rough 1st draft of the Marvel universe (namely Iron Man) which it probably was, considering it's where it all started.
Ant-Man felt like the 1st IronMan movie 2 me. That's good. It did feel like 2 films grafted onto each other. Not as good, but not bad either

Ant-Man was brilliant. Inside Out was spectacular. What a great year for movies so far. Loved today, just sat in the cinema!
Ant-Man was even better the 2nd time
Ant-Man was high on my list to see, but didn't get the chance until Tues night. It was such a fun movie! Ant-man v Falcon...classic!
Ant-Man was ok. Loved the action, first hour dull, 2nd hour great, villain was actually a good villain.
Ant-Man was ok. Nothing amazing but Marvel evil for having me sit through the longest credits to see the 2nd end credit scene.
Ant-Man, Edge Of Tomorrow, Inside Out, Inglourious Basterds and Obvious Child (my favourite of the week) #myweekinmovies

I finished first at TimePlay when I saw Ant-Man tonight. I think I may have peaked. #AntMan #DreamBig
I got 3 options on Friday   Suck it up and watch Fantastic Four  Watch Ant-Man, again   Or watch Mission Impossible:Rogue Mation
I had a really great time watching Ant-man, reminded me of the 1st time watching Iron man , where the character tries to learn who he is

I plan to see the Fantastic 4 movie Tuesday. I went to see Age of Ultron and Ant-Man the Thursday night before.

If you're having doubts about Ant-Man, just go and see it, you won't be disappointed. He may not be a major character, but the movie is good

In other news I saw Ant-Man! It may have a few flaws but I absolutely loved it! So funny and the character is brilliant

It's the first of August and started off good with Ant-Man.
Just found myself googling 'ant man quantum realm reflection'. I may be thinking about Ant-Man too much. It is ace though.
Just saw Ant-Man in the theatre for the 3rd time.  It's still super great.
Last day for ANT-MAN!  MISSION IMPOSSIBLE ROGUE NATION opens FRI!  I am so impressed with this movie!  Don't miss it! http://t.co/9oBvQ08q1w
Looks like ANT-MAN is gonna hit #1 for the 2nd straight weekend. Not to mention, also pass the $100 million mark. Not too shabby........
M:I 5 was... ok. Nowhere near as awesome the 4th was. Glad I didn't spend $11 at the theater for it. I would rather watch Ant-Man again.
Many blessings lately: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Got out to the theater last Saturday to see Ant-Man . Not only http://t.co/W89o80a6Tf
Marvel kicks off the presentation! Alan Horn starts by praising Ant-Man's #1 opening, which he says is Marvel's 12th consecutive #1 opener.
May go see Ant-Man tonight. Anyone interested?
Maybe on Monday I'm going to see Ant-Man with the squad
Michael Douglas may not be coming back for another Marvel film...he did so good in Ant-Man though
Might just have to go see Ant-man tomorrow
My cousin snapchatted me "Ant-man tomorrow. You good?" And these are the reasons we get along so well.
My dad and sister will try out Daredevil series tomorrow. They really liked Ant-Man when I recommended it to them...  HEHEHEHEHE!
My plan for tomorrow's surprise day off is to finally see Ant-Man.
No work for the rest of the week means Ant-Man tomorrow morning, followed by a trip to the comic shop, and much lazing about.
Nothing like finishing the last day back to work with Friday's, and Ant-man.
Now going to watch Ant-man for a 2nd time and drving everybody...
Now that there's several 2D showings of ANT-MAN a day, maybe I'll actually see it... like tomorrow.
Ohhhhh, do I see MI:5 or Ant-Man on Friday at the cinema... Hmmmm.
Okay, I forgive the makers of Ant-Man for omitting Jan Pym. It's a funny, exciting, heist film with a lot of honor to dads. Go see it.
Or tomorrow I don't care but I want to watch Ant-Man
Paid my bills, bought some groceries, did a bit of price-shopping on some clothes, and bought my ticket for Ant-Man later tonight. #Saturday
Paul Rudd stars as ANT-MAN, showing tonight, tomorrow and Sunday. Rated PG-13. Showtimes are at 7:15 each night.... http://t.co/pyfw5j7Su9
Planning to watch Ant-Man tomorrow and see all the fuss about .... I hope I won't get disappointed .....
Probably why Marvel is waiting to show the Civil War trailer until late Sep/early Oct to give ppl enough time to get caught up w/ Ant-Man
Question... is Ant-Man any good? tempted to go watch it tomorrow
Recording a new Fanboy Versus tomorrow with @BeatlesDiva @chrismcfeely @manofthetown and @BKilby Talking Fantastic Four, Ant-Man and more!

Saw Ant-Man on Tuesday. Great film. Much more character driven than the big epic MCU films.
Saw Ant-Man tonight and loved it! Here's my blog review: https://t.co/oV4GXcgxyh Any views appreciated! #AntMan #marvel
Saw Ant-Man tonight with friends. My 3rd time. Fun.
Seeing Ant-Man on monday, finally. 9pm showing, so i'll be useless the next day. And I don't care.
Seeing Ant-Man tomorrow, flat, it just isn't worth $40 *more* to see it in 3D. We'll just have to use our imaginations.
Seeing Ant-man for the 2nd time (@ AMC North Point Mall 12 - @amctheatres for Ant-Man in Alpharetta, GA) https://t.co/Cq4u1kX4GM
Shoutout to @bthousto for going with me to see Ant-Man (highly recommend) and scoring us free ice cream yesterday. Best 2nd to last day here
So.. finally saw @AnnaAkana in Ant-Man, I thin i may have zoned out starin at her tho cuz i remember nothing the guy said except "yes"
Somehow I was able to enjoy the 2nd half of Ant-Man in spite of my gleeful anticipation about all the Ant-Lamb jokes I couldn't wait to make
Somehow got wrangled into seeing Ant-Man again tomorrow with another group of friends. Ehh, I don't mind much tbh
Star&gt;Box Office:Ant-Man Stomps on the Competition for 2nd Weekend at 1:Marvel Studios' Ant-Man was 1 at t... http://t.co/JJ91tt9Krc #actors
Still really want to see Ant-Man, hopefully tonight or tomorrow.
Summer is BUSY! Saw Ant-Man with super heroes LilF and @TheAndyRok. Tomorrow Minecraft with @Parker_GamesMC and @JoinSuperLeague
Sunday recovery continues with this, then Ant-Man http://t.co/stgiu1rmNL

Swapped out broken Franken-part in my car, saw Ant-Man with family, took a nap, wrote for a bit, ate Ice Cream. Saturday: victorious.
Tfw ur on ur way to see Ant-Man for the 3rd time

The best CGI in Ant-Man isn't the ant scenes. It's that 1st scene with Michael Douglas' face. #smhowzow
There are people who only watched Ant-Man for the Upstate NY cameo and the 2nd credit scene. Civil War is going to be pretty big.
Thought about seeing the new Fantastic Four movie today. Passed and saw Ant-Man for a 2nd time instead. LOL #AntMan #FantasticFour
Tickets to see Ant-Man with @HannaK108 and @TheLostLaurens this Friday! Looking forward to it, heard such mixed reactions to the film

Took the day off work and treated babe to some Big Biscuit and saw Ant-Man. Some Monday's aren't too bad.
Trying to get tickets to the "Ant-Man" preview showings on Wednesday. The theaters are fucking packed, bro. I'm kind of happy...Paul Rudd!
Unexpected development-- saw Ant-Man on Saturday night in London. It was surprisingly charming. I actually quite enjoyed it.
Very excited to see Ant-Man tomorrow but after I've seen it, I will have seen all MCU films this yearAKA I have to wait 9 months for another
Was gonna see Inside Out again tomorrow but I found it a bit disappointing so we'll probably watch Ant-Man again
Watched Ant-Man for the 2nd time today, and thought of 2 more reasons to see it again: to catch the Easter eggs and catalog its Britishisms.
Watched Ant-Man for the 3rd time for free, technically because it's with family. :)))
We hope you are enjoying Pixels.   Ant-Man will start this Friday.  Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing... http://t.co/mgtdzWd3jN

What are the chances of Ant-Man still being in theatres on August 20th when I get to Halifax?
Who wants to go see Ant-Man tomorrow? I believe it's a film about a man who's imbued with all the powers of a guy named Anthony.
Who wants to see Ant-man with me tomorrow ://
Why it's great to go see Ant-Man in IMAX (or any movie, really), at the Tuesday late night showing. http://t.co/lk2n6zQh9q
Will someone go see Ant-man with me tomorrow? I'm dying to see it
can it just be 5:30 tomorrow evening alREADY because Ant-Man will be over by then and the post credits will BEGIN  https://t.co/wAIUNnsj9i
going to see Ant-Man today then will get pasta, I'm doing all my birthday stuff today because I have band camp tomorrow and that's all day
it's crazy how I swore up &amp; down that "Ant-Man" would stink but I'm excited to see it a 2nd time.
just booked my tickets for Ant-Man for this friday. can't wait!
might as well go see Ant-Man for the 4th time again since its release..
proper geeking out today; Ant-man was so good and Under the dome till i sleep, mate im gonna be dead tomorrow
seeing "Straight Outta Compton" &amp; "Ant-Man" tomorrow is the move.. gotta decide on a 3rd movie as well.
should I force my dad to go to the cinema with me and watch Ant-Man (that would be my 2nd time watching it) (i missed the post-credit scene)
thinking about the number of people who may have discovered The Cure through Ant-Man makes me SO HAPPY
why pack for moving to college tomorrow when you can watch three different trailers for Ant-man instead
@917thebounce may I remind you She's Kida Hot is number one on the iTunes chart while Bad Blood is at number 50 PLAY THE MORE POPULAR ONE
@CSNGiants no more Bad Blood by Taylor Swift music please, the video on Monday was more like badluck!!! #badeditor #SFGiants #cheesymusic
@castlescrumbln A response to Bad Blood may make the album ugly.
Bad Blood is not a music video it looks like a Pepsi super bowl commercial. It's 5 minutes of cameos to a song with 6th grade lyrics
Bad Blood is such a terrible fucking song. I just listened to it for the 1st time and I feel like God took a shit in my ears
Bad Blood may have the absolute worst lyricism I've ever heard in my life (regarding Taylors parts) #UsedtobeMadLove #ReallyDeepCut
Discussing the T Swift vs K Perry feud with boyf (he was unaware). He's a big fan of both. He says he's torn. May have to boycott Bad Blood.
I like Taylor Swift as much as the next man but Bad Blood may be the single worst song ever created in the history of mankind.
If it were Blank Space up for 7 awards tomorrow Taylor would sweep but since it's Bad Blood she'll probably only win 5/10
It's kinda awful when you can relate to that "Bad Blood" song. Bc it's my life Monday thru Thursday. I did NOTHING! And if I did tell me!
Just gonna say it: The lyrics in "Bad Blood" sound like they were written by a 7th grader. "Done" doesn't have two syllables, Taylor.
Listening to Bad Blood on the radio 1st time: this is awful 8: people like this? 15: that bass line isn't so bad  Now: NOW WE GOT BAD BLOOD
Miley doesn't like the "Bad Blood" video, says things about drugs etc http://t.co/1phoN7gN5T http://t.co/vN1xBZsKW9
My parents' car rendition of Bad Blood may actually kill me one day
Nieces were play Taylor Swift...I submit that "Bad Blood" may be the worst lyrical train wreck in music history. Just abysmal shit. #Duh-un?
Taylor Swift's song "Bad Blood" may be the most annoying song that's currently playing on the radio #TooRepetitive
That Taylor Swift 'Bad Blood' may be the worst quality/budget music video I've ever watched
#TheSecret says visualizations come true, so tomorrow night @taylorswift13 is bringing me on stage for Bad Blood, you guys.
1st day training Taylor Swift for her MV "Bad Blood". She was a sweetheart and picked up quick! http://t.co/oTSKXhY4pp
1st thing I did after baggage claim was get up to date with @RonnaAndBeverly. Bad Blood Ronna &amp; Bev style makes being home a bit more okay
@VirginRadioTO I will be spending my Friday night listening for Taylor Swifts "Bad Blood" on the #1 radio station Virgin Radio 99.9 :)
@XFilesNews doing a #XF3DayHiatus watch over the weekend! Sat Bad Blood, Sun Arcadia, Mon PMP all at 8pm EST - join in the fun!
@justinrivera86 @ARizzo44 Let's see, there's "Good vibrations," Trap Queen, "Bad Blood," .... can't remember what he uses for 4th at-bat.
@matt205camp you may not like the song but that doesn't change the fact that it was a big deal."Anaconda" broke a record before "Bad Blood"
@taylornation13 I love Taylor Swift I'm going to her concert on September 13, I love all of her songs especially  Bad Blood she is my idol!
Anaconda's a music video gem, but T-Swift's Bad Blood is in a classic comedy vault--it's the best of its kind since Rebecca Black's "Friday"
Bad Blood (feat. Kendrick Lamar) by #TaylorSwift is UK's Top 36 on the Singles #Chart as of the 17th of July 2050
Bad Blood by Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift may be my guilty pleasure of the year. I wish more mainstream pop was like this.

I am listening to @aubrey_logan 's (with @PMJofficial) version of Bad Blood for the 11th time this night.Hope you come to Australia with pmj
I love "Bad Blood" and I love the music video, but it is just Taylor acting a damn fool. Like c'mon.
I've just kind of sat here for an hour doing nothing but listening to Bad Blood on repeat, this is normal
Ian McKellen reciting Taylor Swift's Bad Blood lyrics is just amazing http://t.co/gMuVqsJtmS http://t.co/uySOzoXppR
In addition to Bad Blood, my brain is also shuffling the Wonder Woman theme and California Gurls. Still better than November Rain.
Jess Glynne has a song called "Bad Blood" on her new album &amp; I'm seeing her in November &amp; I hope she does a BB/BB Remix.
Just another typical Saturday!!!! Madison is reenacting the @taylorswift13  Bad Blood video with her Dolls

i really sat through, and watched Bad Blood music video, becos i found out my GF was in it.
throwback 4 @NathanKress's poster of Bad Blood, in honor of Taylor's award on VMAs last Sunday. The Law got the power http://t.co/km2fXXC5DP

@BrianaNews may Briana carries his child, but he has been carrying Eleanor on his heart for 4 years, thing that he'll never do with briana
@Louis_Tomlinson wyd mate? 1st you knock up that ugg Briana , &amp; now you unfollow Eleanor on IG. Wyd?Wyd?Wyd?
@LycahF but a friend of Briana said that Louis may not be the dad because she's also hooking up with other guys that time
@OfficialWith1D 1st Louis doesn't like blond hair he lvs brown hair!2nd Harry has dimples! 3rd Harry is cute af! So Briana can get lost!
@briana_alberto @Dreinaaa21 then this shit better fucking end tonight Briana and I don't want to hear anything from you tomorrow or ever
@carlalyttle @UnitedByLarry That's Ashley in the 1st pic not Briana but the pregnancy is still fake af
@castielnov4k yea look at the 1st tweet of Briana's failed tweets she posted(she tweeted this pic earlier) https://t.co/8euxvQN3pM
@headlineniaz @fandombeliefs youre in denial jfc . the babys born in February right , watch briana get a "miscarriage" or some shit .
@misfitstylinson @ilovebrianaj guys chill we dont know shit about briana we may not like the fact she's here but calling her names is rude
@queenforharry I know for sure that Briana's baby is NOT Louis' ! He may have had sex with her but she did also with someone else sooo..m
@yslnialI ...so a sextape leaks, which may or may not be Briana, and it automatically means management set it up and she's a pornstar...
Anne Hathaway hid her pregnancy so well ppl just found out she's in her 2nd trimester. if Briana is so private why couldn't she do the same?
Briana added tons of shit from Sunday work day https://t.co/VuCpPmvB1y
Briana is acting like us not wearing uniforms to school tomorrow is the next world war 2
Briana just sat her ass there while Matt said he's done with her sister? This chic!  She deserves everything she gets! #LittleWomenLA
Fuckin "Briana updates" bitch u may as well start an update account for your shit you so interested in some fake ass "baby mama"
How immature can you be calling Danielle a stunt/beard/December girlfriend? Like he's WAY happier with her than Eleanor or Briana..
I can already see articles talking about this and how he should be w/ Briana or some shit the Sun will bust a nut https://t.co/BfMPwDCERD
Just saying Briana got pregnant when she had a bf in March/April and Louis and eleanor had just broken up isn't that just fishy
Paps: this one if for the sun!! Briana: *stands behind Louis and poses*  So not set up, nope nope nope, not one bit
So Briana is allowed to smoke but not allowed to take photos by fans because it may affect the baby oKAY THEN.
Some say he knocked Briana while with Eleanor but??? She's due in February, do you think she'll be pregnant for 11 months or what?
Stop concentrating on all this Briana drama&amp;concentrate on the fact that THE BOYS 5TH ALBUM COMES OUT IN 4 DAYS #5DaysTillMITAM #OhNoBriana

Tomorrow Modest will show us Louis and briana together. But you know this is a lie. #OhNoBriana https://t.co/idspkKvgZR
Unless Briana was as virgin- the only thing I can tell @Louis_Tomlinson is DNA test! She wouldn't be the 1st trying 2 trap a celebrity...
Wait hw can Louis break-up w/ Briana if she's never been his gf in the 1st place. He knocked her up, yes but gf? Uhm #MTVStars One Direction
What confuses me is that Briana was LITERALLY fuckin pulled out of louis' ass in like may and like 2 weeks later she was pregnant 1+1=76
Why can't people just accept that Louis got Briana pregnant, end of story, move on  https://t.co/khDYyJAK9q
Woaw just because briana is "having" louis' baby she has the sun shining out of her ass. https://t.co/MrOgIi8Eco

"Brock Lesnar.. Attacking me on Monday Night Raw was indeed the biggest mistake you've ever made.. Listen here son. This is not The Deadman-
@LesnarSupport yes. Brock Lesnar will appear tomorrow then he will be gone till before Royal Rumble
@WWE Brock Lesnar may have ended the Undertakers Wrestlemania streak, but he did not keep the Deadman down.
Anyone who has talked wrestling with me knows how much I hate Brock Lesnar. Seeing him at RAW on monday will be literal hell.
Brock Lesnar coming to ESPN tomorrow. To be safe I am going 300 miles away. Let him kill @RoFloESPN and @TheCoachESPN
Currently sweating more than Brock Lesnar, house feels like the sun
Everybody better hide tomorrow. If Brock Lesnar is there he will fuck shit up again. No one is safe lol
Finding it bizarre how they keep having the Undertaker beat the shit out of Brock Lesnar, if he wins on Sunday I'll find it hard to stomach.
I may be bad at sex but I just beat Brock Lesnar at summerslam for the WWE championship so who's really winning?
It never not being fun to see Brock Lesnar kill people &amp; loving Heyman's promo with one problem http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW
Last monday on raw, Brock Lesnar was beaten up by the undertaker.
Last week Brock Lesnar attacked a car with an axe. Tomorrow @JimmyHavoc is going to attack a human with an axe... RIP Will Ospreay.
Listened to Brock Lesnar on ESPN radio this morning and a little disappointed he wasn't able to plug Logan Storley's 1st MMA match Friday.
Surprising end to a Gauntlet Match between Brock Lesnar and the three weakest members of the RAW Roster in WWE 2k14. He lost to the 2nd man.
"If you are not entertained when turning WWE on a Monday night  then there's something wrong with you." - Brock Lesnar. I agree.
#Sharknado3 This is a billion times cooler than Brock Lesnar destroying the catilac with an axe on Monday night raw.
1st time in my life I agree with Brock Lesnar about his Rousey comment. #UFC #WWE
@AstrosCounty I hope he's ready for Brock Lesnar on Sunday.
@DougAndGator971 Monday night, I watched Monday Night Raw instead of the Tigers game. Brock Lesnar destroying stuff is more entertaining.
@HeymanHustle On Sunday, the final chapter to the biggest lopsided rivalry is written. All hail Brock Lesnar! http://t.co/aAMK5VWxGC
@JM90x could basically be a female Brock lesnar type but the standard of competition would have to be higher 1st, I could see it happening
@JerryTravone Travone Who do you think will win this sunday UNDERTAKER or BROCK LESNAR

I do claim Brock Lesnar as one of the best UFC fighters ever because he is the 2nd person EVER to win the title in only his 4th pro fight.
I feel like Brock Lesnar may be the only boyfriend that's safe dating Rousey.
I had a dream that Brock Lesnar won the 3rd annual #WMT because he F5d everyone. I woke up hoping it wasn't a dream.
I hope the Oct 3 special from Madison Square Garden (feat. Brock Lesnar) is broadcast on the Network... 'cause this guy has ringside seats.

I can't wait to watch it this august"@BOOOMBGUY: Everything about Caitlyn jenner irritates me.. When I see the ad of her reality tv show..
I don't care what you say. "Caitlyn Jenner may be charged with manslaughter." makes me laugh every time I read it.
I hear that Caitlyn Jenner may have to go to jail.  I guess she committed MANslaughter!  @embowlin @bassett_will http://t.co/V17ylwfMVv

Prosecutors began reviewing evidence on Tuesday in the fatal crash involving Caitlyn Jenner: http://t.co/7TByQr8n4t
Regardless of how "courageous" Caitlyn Jenner may be he still makes an ugly ass women lol
She may be trans, but she has 100 million to wipe away her tears from being discriminated against. I feel no sympathy for Caitlyn Jenner.
Since the crash happened in February, that means that they can't charge Caitlyn jenner with manslaughter if Bruce jenner commited the crash.
So Caitlyn Jenner may face man slaughter charges. He thought that the sex change would be easier for when she goes to prison
So Caitlyn Jenner may face manslaughter charges.  The jokes just write themselves these days... #TransCriminal

@spacegirlgail @darrenrichman all I think about w. Cate Blanchett is her odd accent in How To Train Your Dragon 2. Films may be wasted on me
Wrestling w/ why I don't love CAROL unreservedly, &amp; it may come down to this: I don't love Cate Blanchett as an actor. So that's out there.

#JohnKerry says #ISIS had a "rationale" for the Charlie Hebdo killings in January (pic of Muhammad), but Friday night in Paris was different

@BrunoTertrais @bbclysedoucet this photo is from January after Charlie Hebdo.  Paris is not looking like this at the moment.
@FoxNewsInsider Thank you @greta to make Hollande come here after Obama snubbed Charlie Hebdo march and Paris is a national embarrassment

@MaccaNow Photo was from Jan-15 after Charlie Hebdo attack. You may want to delete that tweet....
@NotBabbling Yeah too bad none of the "professionals" had a clue before Friday. Is THAT what it takes even after Charlie Hebdo, to wake up?
@OutTheEU @DMiliband @KayBurley @theIRC Refugee's did not carry out the Charlie Hebdo or the Paris attacks on Friday, you prejudice idiot.
@Sam_Kotrba No, just no. This is after the Charlie Hebdo massacre... In January.        https://t.co/vi4OKUpTFw
@Wielsucker @mewmewmew13 I think after Charlie Hebdo the French did NOT react as the US did after 9/11. But they may do this time around.
@abgstiles @realDonaldTrump the offensive tweets were from Jan 7th after Charlie Hebdo attack dumbass read the date on the tweet
@ifwugrier - 8th floor and desks in the Charlie Hebdo newsroom after gunman threatens to kill hostages if police storm terrorist brothers.
@johnsweeneyroar @BBCPanorama Terror in Paris...in January not just Charlie Hebdo unless dead Jews don't count. #ParisAttacks
@kesterratcliff @aishagani @assedbaig @dats @furqan_naeem @miqdaad Hope The Sun doesn't face the fate of Charlie Hebdo.
@robxkristen indeed, i thought Charlie Hebdo attacks were the wirse in january but no yesterday night was even worse ..
A district with links to Madrid's and Charlie Hebdo's terrorist attacks. A good take on it:  https://t.co/exlNRlkFRz https://t.co/xEfULg0849
All three gunmen in the January attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket were French.
Another pathetic false flag drama like the "Charlie Hebdo" back in January, or a real terrorist attack? Who are... https://t.co/CnxS2JkaPc
Apparently the Charlie Hebdo attacks and the Friday the 13th Massacre happened in the same neighborhood in Paris. Bad neighborhood?
Charlie Hebdo may quite rightly enjoy freedom of speech, but to mock the deaths of over 200 people? I think they have crossed a line
Charlie Hebdo shooting in January, bombing in June, attack on the train in August - @RobLowe has a point.
Donald Trump's response to the Charlie Hebdo shooting that took place in January just shows how ignorant and stupid he really is
Everybody is responding to that Trump tweet but its from January during the Charlie Hebdo shootings... Still not cool but pls check the date
First we had the Charlie Hebdo thing back in January and now this?! WHEN IS THIS FUCKING ISLAMIST TERRORIST SHIT FINALLY GONNA BLOODY END!?!
For months after Charlie Hebdo the government did nothing, worse yet, it lied.  https://t.co/wNi2ropPDl
Guys, that Sky Vine flying around Twitter of the Eiffel Tower going dark is from JANUARY after Charlie Hebdo. Different horrendous tragedy.

Remember how much Charlie Hebdo inched up the dehumanizations of muslims worldwide? that was pittance compared to what will happen tomorrow
Russian lawmakers slam Charlie Hebdo, call it "accomplice of ISIL": On Thursday, the satirical magazine again ... https://t.co/f05AcDxTfg
So that Trump tweet making the rounds right now is a response to the Charlie Hebdo attack back in January, not today's tragedy.
The Empire State Building is not lit up today. This picture was from the January attacks on Charlie Hebdo. https://t.co/pz8SbLk5de
The attacks in #Paris come 10 months after the Charlie Hebdo shootings that left 17 people dead. These attackers picked Friday the 13th.
The fact he sees the rationale of Charlie Hebdo attack is why his policies are impotent against ISIS https://t.co/lioj3kMJgH
This was bozo Trump's moronic Charlie Hebdo tweet from back in January - not about last night's atrocity.  https://t.co/7PBfPcmaM9
Your shameless, disgraceful propaganda war against the 2nd Amendment. Hey ISIS, @NYDailyNews is yankee Charlie Hebdo, and they're unarmed.
and yes I know his tweet wad from the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Don't tweet at me and say "that's from January"
explosive resistant passports!!! Charlie Hebdo shootings left ID card in the car. 9/11 plane hijacker's passports found. Paris c'mon.
hope this isnt another False Flag by MOSSAD in Paris like Charlie Hebdo bullshit. France is playing ball with Israel so it may not be them
they actually went out just this January after the shooting at Charlie  Hebdo which makes today harder #PrayForParis https://t.co/0tGuzzkUA3
@RGerrardActor @anamariabahiana beautiful, but it's from January (Charlie Hebdo)
@bxsicJC @liamaesthetics they turn the eiffel tower lights off in January for Charlie Hebdo...
@dazgale I'm thinking back to the Paris Queen concert in January just after the Charlie Hebdo attack. Jesus.
@holliewithaIE this tweet is from Jan, in reference to Charlie Hebdo. he's still an absolute helmet though
Before we were all Charlie Hebdo, now we are all Parisian - tomorrow we may have to identify with others, but we must not be intimidated

@BBCBreaking come on C4 revamp it there, TF1 Sunday with Chris Evans? Please no. I'll just watch the full races and nowTV the good Sky ones.
@BBCRadio2 Chris Evans should lose his voice more often if it means we get more listenable breakfast shows like this Monday and Tuesday's.
@SaturdayKitchen  Saturday and Sunday K, is a tradition, but please no more Chris Evans  he has too much to say,&amp; ruined the show!!
Because seriously, who the **** is Chris Evans? Virtually world famous in all of England. Real stars like Sabine may save that show but...

Haven't seen TFI Friday before but it's hosted by Noel Fielding and Chris Evans (the shit, English one) so I want it off television soon
I like it when a celebrity that's crap at cooking goes on Saturday Kitchen. Chris Evans looks like he's never used a whisk in his life.
Is Noel fielding having a chat on tfi Friday or is Chris Evans going to keep on rabbiting another break "groan"!!!
Is the Chris Evans show really bad this morning or is it Monday morning blues?
Just turned onto TFI Friday. Chris Evans is clearly still trying to get Charlene Spiteri from Texas into bed. Give it up man, you're fifty.
My icon may be Seb and I may talk about Seb 24/7, but I am just as much Chris Evans trash as I am Sebastian Stan trash
Never mind TFI Friday, I wish he  would bloody end his Chris Evans &amp; His Celebrity Chums Chat Show on Radio 2.
Rumours that Chris Harris may join Chris Evans on Top Gear. They'll have to make extra wide doors for 2 such fantastically egotistical twats

Seen a advert for today's Saturday kitchen ... Chris Evans looks like he's just come out of a ket gaff from Saturday ! The shuffling twat
TFI Friday and Chris Evans need to fuck off back to the 90s
TFI Friday is just Chris Evans having a mid life crisis live on TV
TFI Friday was good in the 90s because it was new and Chris Evans was young.  Someone needs to tell him this is crap and dated.
The rejuvenation of TFI Friday, ergo giving Chris Evans the opportunity to appear on TV more, is very disheartening.
Watching TFI Friday, WTF has Chris Evans done, has he had surgery? Just doesn't look right, grow old gracefully fella!!
Watching TFI Friday/The Chris Evans Show:D Nothing like it used to be. Talk about painful to watch. Some things are best left in the past.
Well done Chris Evans, I did not think it was possible to make TFI Friday any more shit than it used to be, but you have proved me wrong

@boxingrich regardless of what he may say, a former boxer smashing UFC's biggest star last night was Dana White's worst nightmare
And the UFC is fucked up, Why you may ask? Because they are all getting hoed and controled by Dana White
Biggest problem with UFC is that Dana White seems to feed sheep to lions for ticket sales. It's not exactly fixed but it may as well be.
Dana White &amp; Joe Silva are scum bag atheists and Ronda Rousey is endorsing Bernie Sanders. Don't give them your money. Stream the UFC on Sat
Dana White coming off as an asshole telling Holm's camp about immediate rematch in July &amp; she can't fight Tate. Selfish. What else is new.

Dana White is a terrible promoter sometimes. Instead of praising Holm her for her performance, he says Rousey had a bad night? C'mon man.
Dana White is gonna use Sean Shelby and Joe Silva as the scapegoats tomorrow, if not tonight.
Dana White may as well come out as being a faggot with how much he sucks Ronda Rousey's dick
Dana White may be to blame for arguably the greatest UFC fighter ever not returning https://t.co/umPIWncXjR https://t.co/ZA6kEwvtnv
Dana White will lose a 3rd #UFC meal ticket within a month tonight. Rousey, VanZant, McGregor #BetOnAldo UFZzz
Hahaha can imagine Dana White may want to kill himself after that Rousey fight
Helwani to Dana White "good luck tomorrow" you fucking sheep
I fucking hate Dana White, let's not give Aldo a 2nd chance in a 13 sec fight but let's give Rhonda a rematch when she gets destroyed.
If Dana White was smart, he would've waited on this fight. Stretched it out May v Pac style. McGregor is a promotional magnet. #UFC
If I'm Holly Holm I think I go to Dana White &amp; hold him hostage. But I may just enjoy chaos a little too much
If McGregor loses tomorrow night, Dana White will be the most butthurt dude on planet Earth
If he gets the crap beat out of him Saturday, Dana White may die.  https://t.co/qUL45Gd5Lx
Lol dana white ain't happy /w the ways things are going, tomorrow he'll be furious. #mma #ufc194 https://t.co/Bg2MPnzU7e
Lol desperate AF! "@UFCONFOX: Dana White confirms UFC going to Brisbane, Australia on March 19, 2016 #UFC193"
Someone may want to check on Dana White.... He's somewhere sick right now
There will never be women in the UFC Dana White a few years ago...as Ronda Rousey headlines her 3rd or 4th UFC card. What a bonehead he is
'Dana White' appeared on Sunday 13 at the 20th place in the Top20 of Miami's Trends: https://t.co/OZrErVV59x #trndnl
.@SirJamieH I first saw him on Dana White's pilot episode and saw his fight in October - he does look impressive
@LiverKickdotcom like tomorrow if Dana white tweeted what a glory fan he is, these same people would come running so hard they'd faceplant
Dana White announcing Holm v. Rousey scheduled for July 9th. Can't wait for the rematch
Dana White may very well have the world's best piece of furniture. "Any questions?" Nope. We're good here. https://t.co/E4EWMcPPv1
Dana White says rematch #RouseyVsHolm is on for UFC200.  It will be at the new Las Vegas arena.  I think this could be bigger than May-Pac.
Danny White to be announced as UCF AD on Thursday. Not to be confused with Dana White. Another ND alum like Orsini.
Frankie Edgar shows Chad Mendes and Dana White that he deserves a title shot:  https://t.co/PE0LYAuL1d
I called it "Ronda Vs Holly 2" Dana white and Ronda have said Yes there will be indeed Be a 2nd fight! so there you go MMA Fans! Yay!!!
I've got Aldo winning by TKO in the 3rd round but if it goes to the judges McGregor wins cause you know he's Dana White's golden boy #UFC194
KO's theFW en route to 5th straight win. Then calls out Dana White in the post fight.  https://t.co/ndPUo2PoIy https://t.co/veCdjDpffU
Pool Party Stories: Dana White treats both teams to some fun in the sun https://t.co/g3XhRfnYjg
RIP the Rousey circus. Dana white; a "once ever athlete" after 12 wins...liverpool won 12 in a row in 13/14 and finished 2nd!
Rousey is to Dana White what AJ is to Eddie Hearn, their wee pet projects, be great 2 see Eddies wee pets career take the same hit on Dec 12
WHOA. Dana White just said that if Ronda Rousey wins tomorrow, Cyborg is next. Superfight may be just a few months away
@BrocketyBrock Which may people think it is a bad game and that the major issue of Dark Souls games
@Campbell_Soupss I liked it a lot. Held my attention much better than Dark Souls. I may have to go back to that now.
@DrtyHippiePanda If I see someone else telling you that I might just fucking burn them alive. May work to do a nice Dark Souls bonfire.
@LoserMcTool Dark Souls is pretty much near the bottom of the list for me to finish, along with many MANY RPGs,gotta get thru short ones 1st
@untimelygamer But then the 2nd half of Dark Souls shits the bed and Dark Souls 2 just doesn't care.
Blighttown may be annoying, but the worst place in Dark Souls, in my opinion, was Crystal Cave. Fuck those invisible platforms.
Dark Souls progress: getting real sick of these Asylum Demon-like bosses. Firesage was exactly the same as Stray Demon! c'mon, Dark Souls
Had a rough time trying to make Dark Souls work with OBS =/ Gonna have to figure out a few things and stream tomorrow i #21053
I don't want fucking Kane &amp; Lynch 2, Microsoft. Hurry up with Dark Souls and Vanquish, will ya? https://t.co/8T76mKcaU3
I think Dark Souls is made of crack. I have to kill the no story series, and start a new series for Monday.
I watched an hour-long speedrun of Dark Souls........he effin' finished the satanic game in 59:49. It took me a year and a half c'mon
No Streamerino tonight, I am too tired to get continuously rekt in Dark Souls. Watch me die tomorrow instead!
Outsider's perspective to Dark Souls: You die a lot and masturbate to the sun.
my life is in fucking shambles and jacob thinks he's real the victim because I wont co-narrate his godawful 5th stab at Dark Souls 2
@DarkSoulsGame This one will finish Dark Souls 2 while awaiting April 12th... Also, a lot of skooma to pass the time.
@Fightincowboy i hope you plan on doing a Dark Souls 3 walkthrough when it comes out in march bro! I literally watch every single DS video
@GaryDooton Since you said Bloodborne may be better than Dark Souls I've been having an almighty internal struggle. You...  might be right.
@GoldGloveTV @VernNotice I'm playing Dark Souls tomorrow.   What have you been doing tonight ya shit?
@Jack_Septic_Eye # Dark Souls 3 comes out in March. I know you love it, and you've tried with Dark Souls 1 &amp; 2 to no avail.
@Jack_Septic_Eye Do think you'll make a video on Dark Souls 3 when it comes out? "Praise the Sun"
@JamieMoranUK Dark Souls 1 is my fav game of all time. Played it exclusively from release date for nearly 8 months.  Became a 2nd home...
@MANvsGAME Cannot wait for you to get back. Hopefully we see you around April for Dark Souls 3 :D!
@NidtheDragon   5. I initially grew interest in Dark Souls because I found out Golden Sun shared the same composer. :V
@NorthernlionLP Would you consider doing some Dark Souls 2 content in preparation for Dark Souls 3 in April?  DLC is great.
@Pieromancer Dark Souls games look fun, I may have to try them out at some point. It's fun watching you play them.
@jimmyglaspy Yes I may pop in to watch you stream Dark Souls, time zone permitting.  Where do you stream, and what's your user name?
@linda_x_senpai if you are enjoying Bloodborne you may enjoy Dark Souls too if you didn't already played it
@mystery_butt i hope you're ready for March 24  because that's when i transmute into Dark Souls Danielle
@nfinitefreetime CAN you beat Dark Souls 2 before tomorrow? Maybe play both, as adventures in the apocalypse will seem nice in comparison.
@xOhaiGinna got me Dark Souls, boys and girls. Looks like we have tomorrow's game picked out for the stream.   You da best, Ginna!
Alright people, you've been waiting for it. Dark Souls. 1 Death = 1 Jalapeno. Tomorrow at 11am PST.  RIP me. https://t.co/9whelmPciD
Apparently Dark Souls 3 may be the end of the series. All I can say is it better be the peak of the series too.
Awesome amounts of support with our special bonus cast with @chelle157 and @TheGameP1t . Go show them some love. Back Tuesday for Dark Souls
Beat Demon Souls. If there is a black friday sale I will pick up dark souls 2, otherwise might just get Dark Souls 1
Bloodborne has the greatest gameplay experience out of all the Miyazaki games I've played.  Dark Souls is my favorite, with BB ranking 2nd.

"america runs on dunkin" may explain why america's in shambles 99% of the time
2nd time going to Dunkin today and there closed. Like no this is not ok
3 time going into this dunkin cause they can't figure out my order. Also they wouldn't accept my coupon that expires in October.
@GetWisdomDude  ....C'mon, EVERYBODY, it's time to boycott Dunkin' Donuts.........FUCK THIS CEO ASSHOLE! ...Come on, BOYCOTT DUNKIN' DONUTS!
@danhattan although that may be true I will never bow to Dunkin. Regardless of how bludgeoned it may leave me
America may run on Dunkin, but it walks all over anyone trying to make a living working there.
Dunkin' Donuts, you were such a huge disappointment to my taste buds that I had to walk over to a nearby Taco Bell to get a 2nd breakfast.
I got an iced coffee from Dunkin donuts this morning and it literally tasted like sink water and it ruined my whole Thursday
I hate myself for doing this. Happy last day at Dunkin tomorrow. May I never have to make a rude bitches coffee again http://t.co/fxfDzctIn5
I haven't even officially started working at Dunkin yet and I already don't want to go in tomorrow lol
Interview tomorrow at Dunkin donuts lol really not where I wanted my first job to be but fuck it I need money
So I was at Dunkin and this idiot messed up my order 4 times then he said he wasn't giving me my order the 5th like what the hell he stupid.
Tried Dunkin's Oreo iced coffee &amp; it's not as good as it *could* be. Then again, I may have too high of hopes for cookie-flavored coffee.
What's the requirement to work at Dunkin? Complete up to 8th grade? Reasons I hate going there. No people skills.
Whoever made this iced coffee at Dunkin' Donuts, does not know what they're doing and it's Monday... #getittogether
Working Friday morning shift at Dunkin is actually the most stressful thing you could do. #godhelpme
You know you have a Dunkin problem when the girl hands you your things and says 'see you tomorrow!'
sad that my dunkin won't have pumpkin coffee till the 29th
$1 monday's at dunkin is the best way to start off the week :-)
@AlexRea98 tomorrow morning before work I'm getting pumpkin coffee from Dunkin, if there isn't any, you're responsible
@ArianaGrande can't wait to see you in DC on Saturday! What kind of donut do you prefer so I know what to pick up at Dunkin? #iloveamerica
@BaileyPerez dont worry! We can stop at dunkin tomorrow and the coffee will wake ya right up shorty!

@Chris__Shield @kizrees at least Dustin Johnson knows how to party which is why I'm guessing he falls apart by Sunday after his weekend out
@KellyTilghmanGC  After the 2nd round, you did your usual melodramatic spew that Dustin Johnson was in a class of his own. Same old garbage.
After 75 today maybe I was wrong about Dustin Johnson getting over US Open collapse. Terrible 3rd RD #OpenChampionship
Also, I see Dustin Johnson is leading after the 1st round of a major again. So he's gonna choke on the weekend again? #boring
Apparently it's not just the final round that makes Dustin Johnson choke it's just Sunday.
Are we taking bets on when Dustin Johnson has a meltdown at the PGA? Saturday? Sunday? #DustinJohnson #PGAChampionship #choke
Can you bet on Dustin Johnson to be top five all week until Sunday when he comes 6th and below? I'd take that...
Did anyone tell Dustin Johnson that winning requires a lead on the 4th day and not just the 1st day?
Dustin Johnson and Sunday's just don't mesh well #PGAChampionship
Dustin Johnson dealt with another major disappointment after shooting +3 &amp; going from leading after 2 at -10 to being tied for 22nd &amp; at -7
Dustin Johnson flies out of the blocks at every major, but he simply cannot get it right on a Sunday.
Dustin Johnson having a complete meltdown on the 1st hole, on the green in 6 or 7 I've lost count. #PGAChampionship
Dustin Johnson is completely melting down. Sunday's just don't agree with him. #PGAChamp
Dustin Johnson is just a pig with this 3rd and 4th round play
Dustin Johnson is just a walking disaster on Sunday's lately.
Dustin Johnson isn't the first guy to drop 22 places in a major on Sunday, but it usually takes more than 1 hole. #PGAChampionship
Dustin Johnson just can't do Sunday's
Dustin Johnson just took an 8 on the 1st hole. I don't feel so bad about my golf game suddenly. #PGAChampionship #snowman
Dustin Johnson leading the #PGAChampionship ...until the 3rd round of course when he naturally falls apart.
Dustin Johnson off to a flyer yet again! All he needs to do is stay off the coke on Saturday night.
Dustin Johnson shot the 2nd worst round of anybody in the field on a day where literally almost every player was under par, just awful
Just pulled a Dustin Johnson on the 18th at Castle Creek and don't know if I've ever been this depressed
Just your typical Sunday ...Spieth and Day there in the end, while Dustin Johnson falls apart in his final round
Looking at today's play at the #OpenChampionship You can't define Dustin Johnson's round as anything other than a choke. Tied for 2nd worst
Looks like Dustin Johnson won't be winning the pga championship after shooting an 8 on the 1st hole. #choke#PGAChampionship
Oh look dustin Johnson has blew up again lol. 7/4 after the 2nd round in places can now be backed at 50/1. #TheOpen #DustinJohnson #choker
Once again Dustin Johnson is leading early in the tourny, which means he has plenty of time to screw it up on ether Saturday or Sunday
R&amp;A's handling of the end of round 2 was diabolical. I watched Spieth, Matsuyama and Dustin Johnson early Saturday, very unfair on them.
Well Dustin Johnson seems to have the anvil back in his bag on a Major Sunday. Dropped 20 spots on first hole. #SnowMan
Well, Dustin Johnson isn't really in contention but that won't stop him from royally screwing things up on the Sunday of a major.
Whether it's the 3rd round or 4th round Dustin Johnson just doesn't like Sunday's in majors!!
#USPGA Man totally oblivious to Dustin Johnson's tee shot landing beside him at the 17th. #foreleft
8 for Dustin Johnson at the 1st. Playing my kind of golf.
@Brucehillbhoy up there with him and dustin Johnson and I love to see there pain on a Sunday
@JamesFenn90 Like you say, Rory, Spieth, Rose and Day should be great to watch. If Dustin Johnson can get his head together he may join them
@JasonSobelESPN  #espnnow Tell Dustin Johnson that every day is Thursday until Monday morning, please.
@SPeetGolfEast @JamesKent85 Hate to see it. Dustin Johnson on the 1st. #headsgone
@Tyler_Tremelle was angry at me after Friday because Dustin Johnson was outperforming Jordan Spieth. He's now quite happy with me.
@_andrewclarke: Dustin Johnson good 1st day again. Deja vu on him flopping next few days.
@chambleebrandel hey bc watching gc if Dustin Johnson had won a few of those majors , he would be no worse then 3rd in rankings , he's solid
@mygogi I'm thinking Dustin Johnson should get the 4th spot in the #GrandSlamofGolf
And just like that, an opening hole quad from Dustin Johnson.  Best Thursday/Friday major golfer ever.
Can already feel the Dustin Johnson tilt and it's only Monday
Crazy Saturday at British Open Ends Where It Began with Dustin Johnson on Top | Bleacher Report

Dustin Johnson back on top in 1st round of a major can he hold on this time

Dustin Johnson doing it again on a major Sunday. Unreal.
Dustin Johnson ends the first round of a major championship in 1st place. What's a surprise
Dustin Johnson has a great chance to win the @PGAChampionship as long as there is no Sunday round. @DJohnsonPGA

Dustin Johnson has the #OpenChampionship field right where he wants them heading into tomorrow's final round: In front of him.
Dustin Johnson hits off the 16th tee during the second round of the World Golf Championships - Bridgestone... http://t.co/LMvsxg37Iv

Dustin Johnson is the best Thursday golfer on tour
Dustin Johnson just drove a par 4 with an iron! http://t.co/rbprO8BCfW
Dustin Johnson leads the @PGAChampionship at @GolfKohler entering 2nd round play. Can he lead wire-to-wire? 2nd round tee times in one hour
Dustin Johnson makes an eagle on 16 to move to -13. He may not have a major, but boy is he wonderful to watch when on song. #USPGA
Dustin Johnson may wind up being another in the long list of athletes with "million dollar arm and five cent head" ... hope not
Dustin Johnson might be the best Thursday golfer in history. He has to finish a major on top eventually. Has immense talent.
Dustin Johnson might be the best Thursday/Friday golfer on the tour. If only a tournament was two days.
Dustin Johnson must b the best opening 18 player at a Major ever, wonder if he'll ever manage it down the stretch on a Sunday though?#USPGA
Dustin Johnson quadrupled bogeyed the 1st hole? At least he got it over with quick this time
Dustin Johnson rolls to a Thursday clubhouse lead in a major, of course: Perhaps it's a good thing Dustin John... http://t.co/5wBjjjeb6f
Dustin Johnson setting the pace again. Hope he waits until at least Sunday before imploding.
Dustin Johnson shot 66 to lead after day one at Whistling Straits. 1.33am BST Piercy gets up and  http://t.co/P4mvy2QdMG
Dustin Johnson staggeringly bogeys 18th after 3 putts from off front of the green. He'll rue that round for years. A 75 to be -7. #TheOpen
Dustin Johnson straight dominating the majors on Thursday and Friday and folding on the weekend. #boogersugarftw
Dustin Johnson sure knows how to get an early lead on Thursday, he just can't hang on to that lead on Sunday
Dustin Johnson took advantage of favorable morning conditions to take an early lead at the US PGA Championship Thursday while Tiger Woods
Dustin Johnson was in the final group Sunday, shot 75, and today he and Jim Furyk are paired 12 games before the final group @TheOpen.
Dustin Johnson will be awesome until he needs a 2ft putt on the 72nd hole come Sunday. Folds like a lawn chair under pressure. #PGA
Dustin Johnson with a snowman (8) on the first already.. Hes starting his usual Sunday form early!! He loves snowmen and sneachta!!
Dustin Johnson would be the greatest golfer in the world right now if he could play the weekend like Thursday and Friday in majors
Dustin Johnson, so often the nearly man at the majors, eagles the par-5 16th to share the early PGA Championship lead at four under.
Dustin johnson always starts well 1st round leader 20/1 !! Must had a fat one b4 he started !!
Getting hype about the PGA Championship on Thursday! As much as I want Tiger to win I'm throwing my duckets on Dustin Johnson.
Great round at Northern Pines! Two birdies on the card with an 85. Finished 2nd to Dustin Johnson #ChampionsTour
Guess what everyone it is Thursday of a major so you guessed it Dustin Johnson is killing it -4 through 7 #hewillchokeonSunday
He's a very fast starter in the first round in Majors, but will Dustin Johnson strike it third time lucky come Sunday? #Majors #golfchat
I feel like Dustin Johnson always  has the lead early on and ... Well you know  https://t.co/C7HEPWaKNQ
I like Dustin Johnson a LOT but I have no confidence in him closing out a major ---unfortunately he probably won't get a chance tomorrow
I see 'Sunday Major Dustin Johnson' showed up today. +4 after the first... #roughstart #fightback #PGAChamp
I swear Dustin Johnson is winning at the end of the 1st-3rd rounds of every golf major
If Dustin Johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad, we have a ball game. He's still fun to watch
If the PGA tour just played Thursday Friday Saturday. Dustin Johnson would win every tournament
If you could win a golf tournament on the 1st day, then Dustin Johnson would have 9 majors by now.
Is Dustin Johnson the best 1st round player of all time? @ksalvo21
Is the 12th playing down wind?  Because Dustin Johnson just hit a pitching wedge 150 yards.
It may not be Sunday, but Dustin Johnson is still getting last round jitters. He's started with four bogeys! #DeutscheBankChampionship
It's Thursday and Dustin Johnson is crushing it at a major. All is right.
It's the Rd 1 Dustin Johnson show rearing its head again at another major. He leads by two, but Sat and Sun will tell the tale #PGAChamp
Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson in 2nd, it's a good day
Just saw live scores amazing effort from Dustin Johnson to be back in 1st place, not surprising  Tiger with a 75
Kudos to Dustin Johnson for finishing with a 69 after starting the day with a quadruple bogey. An 8 on the 1st could've led to an 80+ easy.
Man if this guy could just do this on a Sunday. Dustin Johnson can just obliterate a golf course when he's on. Better make it 8000 yards.
Next time Dustin Johnson tees off on a Sunday in contention in a Major want him decked out in Godolphin blue #uspga
No surprise: Dustin Johnson had a strong 1st rd Thursday at PGA Championship. Can he sustain it through weekend? http://t.co/goOqMTpsuy
Not sure I could muster the mental strength to play 17 more holes after  doing what Dustin Johnson just did on the 1st. #PGAChampionship
Of all the things I'm envious of when it comes to professional golfers, Dustin Johnson's strut walk may be at the top of the list.
Quality start for Dustin Johnson with an 8. He apparently is not a fan of Sunday golf. #PGAChampionship
Really hope Dustin Johnson pulls it out the bag tomorrow and ties up #TheOpen  #Adidas #AdidasGolf
Some round from Dustin Johnson considering he started with an 8 on the 1st. Another case of what might've been for him at Whistling Straits.
THIS OFFER ENDS TOMORROW!   Get Dustin Johnson to finish in the TOP 5 at 3/1 or Jordan Spieth at 5/1 when you join: http://t.co/q7W6jsOxvo
Thank you very much Dustin Johnson. 1st round leader never in doubt!
The 10th hole seems to be a good birdie hole. Dustin Johnson birdies the 10th, his 1st hole to move to -1 #PGAChamp
The winner of the #PGAChampionship  will come from Thursday's 9:05 tee time (Jason Day, Dustin Johnson &amp; Rickie Fowler)   #Prediction #Golf
Things you can always count on on Thursday of a major:  Dustin Johnson leading; Tiger Woods over par.
This Dustin Johnson start is going to be even better when he blows it on Saturday or Sunday.
Tomorrow I'm doing the coolest thing of my life. I'm going to be in a Taylormade commercial as Dustin Johnson's playing partner!!!
Watching Dustin Johnson on Saturday and Sunday is amazing. The guy just can't do it. Ever
Wayward driver puts Johnson off the PGA pace  The horn may have been a welcome sound for Dustin Johnson.  http://t.co/HB9GmCNTSr

Have y'all ever just sat and listened to Frank Ocean's "Crack Rock"? The shit is mad deep.
Hell same with frank ocean, jhene aiko (thanks bre for putting my down 6th grade), and mf Tori Kelly...I remember her YouTube days lmao
Hope I wake up tomorrow to some news about @CHVRCHES Glasgow date, or to frank ocean's new album. Not too much to ask is it?
I can't believe I'm going to see Frank Ocean this Saturday yasss
I can't wait for it to be January 1st and Frank Ocean fans are still crying they ain't get an album
I fear the Internet may end the day Frank Ocean finally up &amp; releases this album
I had a dream last night Frank Ocean said November. Maybe this is it. #CampFlogGnaw
I hope I never forget about Frank Ocean's verse on "Sunday"
I just listened to Strawberry Swing by Frank Ocean 6 times in a row and I'm working on a 7th
I just sat here and cried to frank ocean...... ITS BEEN A WHILE SINCE THAT HAPPENED http://t.co/yjgoMtElLu
I know SiR writes for a lot of ppl but listening to Seven Sunday's wouldn't be surprised if he had Frank Ocean credits.
I think Frank Ocean should release  on November, he's music is great for the summer. @FerreroRocherII @XabisoMkala @Nzame_M
I think I've listened to the same frank ocean song at least 50 times today ..and I will listen 50 more times tomorrow
I think if I wake up one day and realize that I am not married to Frank Ocean I may lose my mind.
I think we all might have to accept that there may never be another Frank Ocean album.  I'm not going to accept it, but we all might have to
I was about to tweet "I'm going to fight Frank Ocean for trolling us with an old mixtape" but then I remembered his verse on Sunday
I'm glad I've already seen Frank Ocean live because he may never perform again at this rate.
I'm gonna be blessed with the 5th album, justin, zayn, frank ocean (when he rises from death), adele.. I'm not stressed
I'm laying in the sun listening to Frank Ocean and I have Hot Cheetos I'm so good right now
If Frank Ocean's next album is as good as the 2nd half of Pyramids then it's going to be a instant classic
If Kanye, Frank Ocean, and Drake all drop albums on the same day, the Internet may never recover.
If we have a chance to make vocal track with the International singer, that person will be Frank Ocean. Happy Friday everyone ! #DreamBig
Im sitting in my car listening to Frank Ocean, thinking about what could have been in life. How's your Monday?
It's August 11th.  Have we all forgotten about the Frank Ocean record?

If you oppose gay marriage on religious grounds, find me anything in the Red Words that say same sex couples are not allowed to wed.

Hulk Hogan, you may not know this because you don't say it a lot, but you can replace the n-word with the word, "brother" and you're fine.
I can't believe this is the 1st time Hulk Hogan has been called out for making a fool of himself. Anyone else notice that guy's entire life?
I'm so over Hulk Hogan. May rant on warm up/raw review. Been over Hogan since the 80s. He's the true "nugget" that won't go down the toilet.

"Fuck wit Dre Day" was really a terrible song. Ice Cube wrecked that beat though on "Friday" (the song).
@Adorelola lol right like bitch did we see stories about Ice Cube being in a classic movie Friday nshit NO it's not a EE documentary
@TIME   Suge is right, that movie is exaggerated. It's almost like Ice Cube wrote the screenplay, just like he wrote Friday by himself.
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Ice Cube got his ass whoop by Ricky Smiley at the beginning of Friday After Next???
First Vin Diesel, then Ice Cube, now back to Diesel......why are people still paying him to make movies?  https://t.co/fdYWKY2rCr
Have you ever sat back and thought why people accepted the name Ice Cube as a reputable rap name?
I don't wanna see Ice cube son re do all ice cube parts.I saw Boyz in da hood 2.A remake of Friday.What's next.All about the Benjamin's 2?!
I forgot all about Ice Cube being in the movie First Sunday. I think I seen this shit in the theaters.
I remember watching Friday I would always think Ice Cube was cute but now he's old :/
Ice Cube sits at laptop, typing.  CUBE: You got knocked the fuck out, haha!  CUBE'S WIFE: How is Friday coming along?
Need a Friday marathon one of these weekends. Just laugh while Ice Cube's belly gradually grows and his mean mug gets meaner with each movie
So, bone to pick with #HigherLearning - Ice Cube is a 6th year senior, preaching race politics &amp; activism.  Yet is clearly a lazy rich kid.
The most unrealistic thing in any movie was in "Compton" when Ice Cube was sitting in front a Mac with Final Draft open writing "Friday."
This is literally the exact same mistake Ice Cube made with 'Friday'. Don't do dis. https://t.co/tIn7Ql0hTR
"@chrisbrown: I think Chris Tucker and ICE Cube should really make another FRIDAY!!!" &gt;&gt;&gt; I know right
"Group spent its apex, in part, defending its 1st Amendment rights. But, at his most dangerous, Ice Cube seemed protected by the 2nd" #NWA
"Straight outta Compton" was so live the fact that they had Ice Cube actually rehearsing his lines for Friday ..

.@FGaryGray interesting metatextual touch with Ice Cube's son delivering the "Bye Felicia" line from Friday to the girl at the party in SOC.
5th grade me and luh Jeff memorized all the NWA songs. Lol then I learned all Easy E and Ice Cube solo career songs I really been wit it
@1Xtra Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Biggie, Tyler the Creator, Dr Dre. If I could have a 6th I would add Ice Cube
@DaniBooThang @indeliblemarq__ my 13 yr old cousin didnt know Ice Cube was a rapper...just an "superstar actor"  from the Friday movies lol
@Fengxii nobody takes away from Ice Cube because he wants to make a third Friday movie, he's earned it! Likewise, Knuckles.
@GeeeeMaaan alright. Guess I'll watch it tomorrow then. Is Ice Cube in it?
@ItsNotZ may be unpopular opinion but Ice Cube was the one with the lyrics.
@NicAlmighty come on, you know most white people know about Friday. It was the only movie that I wasn't scared of Ice Cube.
@SoFLA4Lyf prolly Sunday. I feel like this movie will be crazy. You know the Ice Cube actor is actually Ice Cube's son?
@TraciBraxton Westside (Ice Cube voice) listen to Shirley's strawberry letter on 102.3, then 93.5 for West Coast Wednesday all day, ON WEED!
@arlene_santana Nice I love it Arlene!! I think the good Friday movie characters Ice Cube &amp; Chris Tucker love it too! http://t.co/ztIuRx7K3w

@icecube Now I'm thinking about Ice Cube, especially about eyebrow. Japan is almost 14th. I wanna go US to watch the movieeee!!!
@icecube finished watching it for the 2nd time! I got nothing but respect for you Ice Cube!
@n_seaweed Did you know that the Director and Ice Cube created the "Bye Felicia" phrase when they did the movie Friday together?
@redeyechicago @RiotFest I mean... I've seen No Doubt a few times. But c'mon, it's ICE CUBE!
A few days ago @Quuuise said Ice cube may be the bet rapper lyrically I'm starting to agree
Ain't seen the sun in 66 days ,  let me count the ways in a fucked up base ( Ice Cube -  5K )
Also the correct Top 5 is Eminem, Jay-Z, 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube in that order with Big Pun as the 6th man
Although, I'm looking at his filmography right now and literally the only other film of his I've really liked is "Friday" with Ice Cube.
Ampt going to see my baby Ice Cube in in NWA this Friday :)
Block party is on got the kids dancing its a good Friday yo..as Ice Cube wud say "today was was a good day"...
But on the real there may never be a bigger rapper/activist/filmmaker/businessman better than Ice Cube...
Can't wait for barbershop 3 and the last Friday to come out. Ice cube is a top actor
Chris Tucker hasn't lost a step but I wish he would do one more Friday, Ice Cube pay the man lol
Chunky black men are just *eyes emoji* I had the biggest crush on Ice Cube in Friday. Don't @ me.
DC Young Fly and Ice Cube's son GOT TO make Friday
Due to my boyfriend, Ice Cube, not actually being in the movie "Straight Outta Compton" I will save my hard-earned cash for "Last Friday".

Happy Twitter Thursday @DJDocB @Capponair @Power99Philly. Can you play we be clubbin by Ice Cube or Feel Good by Mase.
Haven't played ball in a while, definitely gotta go Ice Cube on a good day tomorrow at the gym.
Heaven knows I'm not on here to self promote- I'm here for the conversation - but my new show with ICE CUBE is up http://t.co/728FWZAmj4
High point. Ice Cube's son was the mvp of this movie. Whoever played Eazy should get 6th man of the year. Whoever casted Snoop shoot them.
Hyped to watch Straight Outta Compton on Friday, do you think they'll cover Ice Cube's family movie phase
I enjoyed a day of fun in the sun with this beautiful lady today. In the words of Ice Cube, "Today was a good day." http://t.co/7nmBZxvdUJ
I feel like Ice Cube: Today was a good day.  Not just for a Monday, but all the way around. I like today very much.
I feel like there will be another Friday and Ice cube will have his son play in it with him
I just want to watch Friday with every human that I can't stand. Just so Ice Cube and Chris Tucker can "Bye Felicia" all you dumb bitches.
I like Ice Cube, better than any of NWAs songs after the 1st album. Death Certificate is MY LP. 2015 &amp;we still bustin up the chiffarobe
I loved Ice Cube's son's comments about people who didn't get that "Bye Felisha" originated from Friday @OsheaJacksonJr
I loved the scene in #StraightOuttaCompton where Ice Cube was working on his screenplay for Friday. That was so inspiring, man.
I think Ice Cube may be the greatest rapper ever...
I want to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday.
I was watching Friday rn and Ice Cube uhh was pretty good looking if you ask me
I'll use a more recent example. When was the last time you got excited about a "new Ice Cube record?" By most standards he may be top 25 OAT
I'm watching the movie Friday, on a Friday and I'm going to see Ice Cube next Friday http://t.co/ockbyJYuui
Ice Cube "Bye Felicia" on #StraightOuttaCompton was waayy funnier then when he said it on Friday
Ice Cube and O'Shea are gonna appear tonight may the Lord have mercy on my soul. They're so damn fine.
Ice Cube gives Iggy Azalea the nod of approval: 'She makes dope songs' | Music | The Guardian http://t.co/he1gSdLiHL
Ice Cube has framed Craig as an attractive man with attractive love interests in every "Friday" movie.
Ice Cube is like 7th on my Greatest MC list and he is #2 in my diss records list.
Ice Cube is suppose to play "Straight Outta Compton" on Friday, and i'd be sooo down to watch him perform "I ain't the 1" #RiotFest
Ice Cube managed to make all three Friday movies different but all still hilarious
Ice Cube may be the realest rapper alive
Ice Cube one of the gods of nigga movies. He wrote Friday, Players Club, and All About the Benjamins, not to mention his acting credits
Ice Cube please make a another friday. Do it with Dae daes character smokie, and yourself. Pretty please#Cube Vision
Ice Cube son and @DCYOUNGFLY to do an our generation Friday would be the DOPEST thing ever!!!
Ice Cube still look the same as he did in the Friday movies.. Everybody else looking old
Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr may very well be the Denzel Washington of our generation. Dude is a beast
Ice Cube's son better be in the new Friday movie
Ice Cube's son is hella sexy. I may only think that cuz I've always had a thing for Ice. His son is just more, like, attainable. lol
Ice Cube's son was born. February 24th 1991. I was born February 19th 1993. he 24. im 22. we're Pisces. we're perfect for each other! really
Ice Cube. the film the 46 year old L.A. native wed to Kimberly Woodruff-takes Us back.
Ice cube can produce some good movies. We just need another Friday
Ice cube is a genius tbf, didn't know he actually wrote the screenplay for Friday
Ice cube made today was a good day. And wrote and starred in Friday. Today we bump cube.
Ice cube son and Dc Young Fly should make a Friday I wanna see the outcome
If Chris Tucker and Ice Cube not in the next Friday I don't want to watch it.
If nothing else, Straight Outta Compton was worth it just for Ice Cube laughing at his own script for Friday. Seriously, tho. Amazing film.
In honour of Ice Cube I'm smokin 2 blunts and drinking an Old English right before watching the movie Straight Outta Compton tomorrow.
It would have been cool if Ice Cube was staring out of the window at his neighbor when they showed him writing Friday. #HeyMissParker
LMAO!   #ByeFelicia - Ice Cube   #StraightOuttaCompton   (Is that where it all started and moved on into Friday? LOL)
Let the chips fall where they may- Ice Cube
Listen. I have Ice Cube my money the 1st time. Cyss gon watch bootlegs till I die my nigga.
My favorite part of Straight Outta Compton was when Ice Cube said Friday was going to be funny.
My review of "Straight Out of Compton" If you like Ice Cube, you may like his son better. plus "bye Felicia" makes even more sense B +
Never knew Ice Cube wrote Friday. Always thought he just acted in it.
New show! Interview with Ice Cube and O'Shea Jackson Jnr #StraightOuttaCompton http://t.co/728FWZAmj4
Next Friday the best one Ice Cube made
Next Friday, we're screening the Ice Cube classic FRIDAY. Tix just $3 http://t.co/JJ2B8zxSoz #damnnnnnn
No Vaseline by Ice Cube may be the greatest diss I've ever heard #StraightOuttaCompton
Now that the world has accepted Ice Cube son, be on the look out for a Friday Prequel
One thing though: when they show Ice Cube wiring the script for FRIDAY... that was inspiring as hell. A lot more tomorrow.
Only 2 hours left! Gonna be so sick, concert, bachelor party and I get paid to not work on Monday.As Ice Cube would say today was a good day
Receiving an email from BAM in which Ice Cube and Ingrid Bergman were uttered in the same breath may have just made my day.
Remembering how normal it was to see Ice Cube at our high school all the time   Sat right in front of him at a play too lmao
Saw straight out of Compton 3x this week. I can watch it again tomorrow and still be excited. Gain so much respect for Ice Cube
Since Friday, I've been walking around reciting the lyrics to No Vaseline by Ice Cube. It's like I'm a kid again! Wait...
So after watching Straight Outta Compton (which was amazing) Ice Cube may have had one of the best diss tracks of all time! Lol
Song #2 Friday by Ice Cube Just came on and automatically started rapping it haha white ppl aren't ready!
Starting my Friday off with some Ice Cube #westside https://t.co/WZe82Dd2fj
Still can't believe there was a scene in Straight Outta Compton about Ice Cube writing Friday and saying, "This script is funny!"
Straight Outta Compton dragged a little in the 3rd act but was very good. Laughs, tears. And O'Shea Jackson Jr. WAS Ice Cube!
Straight outta Compton Was Hard AF!!! They Made Dr.Dre and Cube Perfectly I Like how they Put the Ice Cube writing Friday In it! Awesome
Straight outta Compton was class, been cruising about like Ice Cube since Sunday.
Taking pops to go see Straight out of Compton tomorrow. Knowing his favorite rapper till this day is Ice Cube.
Thanks to @CaseySoftware and @kinlane I have been reminded that Ice Cube's "good day" was my 4th birthday.

That was a nice nod seeing Ice Cube writing the screenplay for FRIDAY. Another movie directed by F. Gary Gray.
The #ByeFelicia scene is brilliant in @ComptonMovie considering that it originated from #Friday which @FGaryGray directed and Ice Cube wrote
There are perks of being an Oakland Raider. One of them: Ice Cube takes care of you. On Wednesday night, the... http://t.co/q4you0e55o
They might as well drop the last Friday and let Ice Cube son play Craig niggas look jus alike
They should just say fuck Chris Tucker and make another Friday with Ice Cube's son and DC Young Fly
They should let Ice Cube son be the "new" Craig in a Friday movie
They shud've skipped all the stuff abt the Chronic &amp; Ice Cube writing Friday &amp; skipped to them bcoming cool w/ Eazy. Other stuff irrelevant
This nigga in Friday look like the guy who played Ice Cube in Straight Outta Compton

@CraigThomson20 IRA and others killed innocent civilians but the good Friday was meant to be about moving on, noew it rears its ugly head
@DPJHodges But the point is that Corbyn's sympathy for IRA is not relevant in deciding whether to vote same way as him tomorrow
@David_Cameron shame on you and your government. As an ex Tory you disgust me. A soldier arrested over Bloody Sunday. Whilst IRA walk free.

@StephenNolan I'll be glad to see Peter Robinson resign he will be remember as one of the  traitors who has sat in govt with the IRA...

@nickclark32 If the IRA came active again tomorrow, just as big (if not bigger) threat to UK than muslim extremists.  @Sophiesweb33
@rredstockings I personally think the IRA was political- injustice against Catholics may've been the motivating force. Islamists mad dogs.

On Remembrance Sunday my primary thought is of this very day in 1987-when the IRA tried 2 murder members of my family for daring to remember
Presumably, in the balance of justuce, the arrest of soldiers over Bloody Sunday fiasco means old ex IRA members will also be questioned?

I would like to become a celebrity so that I may hit John Cena with a chair actually.
I'm going to be quietly singing "John Cena sucks! John Cena sucks!" to myself for most of tomorrow. Well done, #SummerSlam crowd.
I'm just so boooreeed.... You never know, @rhiannon_daley I may be bored enough to draw you John CENA

yesterday I bonded with a 9th grader over our mutual love for justin bieber and disdain for non-iphones
#mufc really need to sort their shit out! No defenders &amp; attackers! Stones &amp; berahino or Kane, may not be the best yet but would take them
1st they're trying Kane &amp; now Derrick Rose. Yeah, OK. I call bullshit. Lie detector tests should be mandatory when it comes to rape charges.
2nd season epl syndrome would have been worse on kane if he left spurs. Let him suffer it there then improve later
@Aviator973 @ByTimGraham Agree with 1st point, and I can't stand Kane or Blackhaws. I detest slander.
@AxAs23 it's pretty sad, Rooney may be the last one for a long time now unless players like sterling, Kane, stones, Wilson
@Callum_Kimber_C I don't know if I want to see a 3rd, I definitely don't want to see Kane
@Holtarna @BrentZBradshaw @SaveUsY2Jake Big Show and Kane have zero business finishing 3rd and 4th in the Rumble.
@KingOBlackheath Kane and Rooney last night.....may have been the ugliest strike partnership of all time. Horrifying
@Nick422 who hears that Kane may have sexually assaulted someone and thinks "I should call Chicago and see if he's available"? ugh
@PuckinHostile @GradHawksBlog @ChiSox_History as sick as it may sound, I hope Kane gets the indefinite suspension and Hawks get cap relief
@SebSB @SBerahino I really hope he stays now, Even if Kane dies of exhaustion by November
@SpursOfficial @rapharris_ tomorrow better be a busy day or expect Kane to be fucked half way through.
@WinslowHorne @broach93 1. Agree, that dude is fast. 2. Wat. 3. Friday's. 4. Should've sold Kane when he was worth anything
@_socoamaretto If Kane doesn't find his Nov-Mar form again I think they could be in for a very bad season. Dier-Mason is the kind of...
@guyfarmer1978 lol, true. The other striker you do have were trying to take off your hands by Tuesday, lol!! Kane has lost his confidence!
@ironviews Good article, and good point about Sakho. He could be sat here now in the same situation as Kane, with people starting to doubt.
Didn't it take Kane until, like, November to score his first PL goal last season?
Hawks might have had decision made for them. With Kane case going before grand jury, no way he can be in camp on the 17th, IMO. #NHL
I am hearing a settlement may be in the works with Kane and alleged victim. He might be pulling a Kobe - WHICH MEANS HE IS GUILTY!!
I've been thinking about it... Does anyone else find it disturbing how Kane may face rape charges and GM's are calling on his availability?
Kane may have raped a woman &amp; the 1st thought teams have is about trading for him? Fucked up. http://t.co/4mB4QYQKKU http://t.co/i1uXbk36y7
Kane might just be going thru that 2nd season syndrome
No way Kane comes here, it's where he gets in trouble the most. Would be kicked out of the NHL by his 30th bday for summer incidents
Real shit vote Kanye for president if he really is doing it , can't stand Donald trump and Kane's my 2nd dad
Same old same old good till the last 3rd no support for Kane no width fuck knows what Poch is doing ain't got a fucking clue
Spurs may aswell make use of adebayor,there paying him millions and there guna need someone when they realise Kane is a one season wonder
Toews backing Kane &amp; Voynov arrested by Immigration in US. Oh, tomorrow is going to be an icky NHL news/comment day.
Too early to sentence Kane.. he is actually shit but u nid 2 gv him time 2 shw up .. eben ladt year he got his 1st epl goals quite late
Would never vote for Kane for president, mostly with Kim Kardashian as his wife. No way in hell is she going to be the 1st lady
and FYI, I never had a HUGE problem with Kane; I just don't have respect for anyone who may of raped someone.
6-0. Shelvey stakes a claim, Delph impressive too and Kane back in the goals in some style. Sets Tuesday up very nicely. ML #BO66Y #England
@AdamOsper @JustinTHFC84 @timabel6 @Paulhitsheet Levy left us short last season but Kane saved our season. This time you may see us drift.
@Allie_Davison  Team Undertaker right here. Thinking we may see Kane tonight though.
@AxAs23 Shaw, Sterling, Ox and Kane may have a chance of being top class in the near future
@BrendanWadlow still see Koivu. You even admitted it was a good comparison like a month back. Kane may be a better one though.
@Corrienationstr I agree with you, because Kane is much cheaper and Bale though a fee is agreeable, he may not want to come.
@JeffGordonWeb U gotta get in front of Kane he's 1st one a lap down!
@KaneAndEriksen @EASPORTSFIFA we adore Kane for being 2nd top scorer ,  he was 2nd top assister
@LethalLaserKJ lol jk, Kane is too valuable. Teams would have to give up 1st liners for him. Dude was 2nd in scoring on the team.
@PeteSchaad @footysoldiers and he was 4th top scorer in Prem last yr after Kun, Kane and Costa honestly surprised no one signed him #vhappy!
@Sirled26 Indeed, hopefully Kane's England success gives his season kick-start it needed. 3 points absolutely vital on Sunday, nothing less.
@THNMattLarkin Kane, Karlsson, Getzlaf, Couture available for my 1st pick. Who would you take? I want Forsberg and/or Buff.
@TheRomanAnoai you've listened good man your 1st tip is to eliminate all allys to seth rollins... J &amp; J / Kane / Triple H / Steph Mcmahon.
@Wonder_Spurs going by the last 3 games yes.I think son may bring last season Kane back.He under to much pressure .We expect to much of him
@adampeacock3 @TheRealBozza @RobbieSlater17 Kane's best service in the 1st half came from the keeper! Says it all
@ahmed_muz No, don't think he's ready yet. With Kane, N'Jie, Son, Chadli &amp; Lamela we have enough options till Jan + Ade in case of emergency
@brewingwins "No!" Am I outa the loop somewhere? This is the 2nd time today I've heard Kane &amp; AZ in same breath.
@foo fighters going to be a great day at Murrayfield please say happy 21st birthday to Kane that would top off his day
@foofighters on our way to Edinburgh it's our son Kane's 21st -we brought him up on great music! Please say happy birthday.thanks guys
@gary302 agreed. Pay 30mill for Kane now or watch him bag 20+ and pay 50 mill in Jan ? The other 2 are going nowhere.
@kanechoa Hi, Kane. We're sorry for the inconvenience. May we please have your ticket number and e-mail address via DM? Thank you.
@nurfgunjake fingers crossed you see kane tomorrow got to meet up with your boyf
@robbieJBhood Kane walked off with a tight calf last saturday. If he starts i guess N'jie will be on the bench.
@thfc53 Lol. Does he seem like a Poch type of player? Or one that would fit in our wage structure? Or play 2nd fiddle to Kane? No.
A mong he may be, but if Kane can produce last seasons form consistently then England have a goal scorer for 10+ years
Been enjoying playing Command and Conquer for it's 20th birthday.  Love the Commando, Love the Rockin' music and Kane, what's not to love!
Can't wait till 6pm tomorrow to come and the only recognised striker have is Kane for rest of season #TransferWindow #pullyourfingeroutlevy
Celebrate the Fall Harvest at the Flickerwood Wine Fest September 26 &amp; 27 in Kane http://t.co/iEh9mU6nc2 #thingstodoinPA #fallharvest
GLEN HODDLE: Harry Kane's impact Friday was extraordinary. It was great to see Kane, the leading Premier League scorer, come on and score
GOAL! Kane 1-0 England   His 3rd in 4 internationals. Shaw with a great pull back and Kane slams it home with his left.   #ENGvSWI
Good finish from Kane, may not rate him that highly but he still scores
Great save by Howard thought Kane got his 1st of the season then tho #EFC #COYB
Harry Kane may be a noble prince but he can't score goals without his army behind him aka WHY IS KANE ALWAYS ALONE UP FRONT CMON GUYS UGH
I am really hoping the #preds aren't one of the 5 teams that called about trading for Kane. Not sure we have enough room for 3rd chances.
I like what I saw tonight, particularly in the 2nd half. 8 up/8 down. Let's keep rolling lads (hey Roy, you play Kane always) #England
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/aCZISHWQI0 Josh Mathews questions the look AJ gave Kane: Raw June 4,
I think some spurs may just be 0 betraying the abilities of Charlie Austin. We need a different option upfront. Too much like Kane #THFC
I want Kane. WE WANT KANE! C'mon! As the Monster Kane, btw #RAW
I'm gonna call out of work tomorrow because Kane turns 1 and it's a big deal #catmom #gotmypictureforinstagramready
Kane &amp; Nathaniel  Kanes 1st day at infant school. Nathaniel's final year in juniors school.  #emotional http://t.co/RYsLPj7Qp1
Kane finding form at the right time, ready to score twice against Sunderland on Sunday...
Kane is going to a jobs fair tomorrow and I just read the first CV he's ever written.  It's awesome!   Is give him a job :-)
Kane really missed Eriksen today. Hardly got a sniff. Still did very well in the 2nd half. Definitely needs someone to support him
Kane records 2nd assist of the half, as he finds Bishop to give @CabriniMSoccer 3-1 lead over @PSUBWSports with 24 min to play #GoCabrini
Kane son Clinton and Lamela as our forward line yea like that going get us top 7 never mind 4th
Kane will indeed return this Monday on #RAW. Also, Edge &amp; Christian will be on the #StoneColdPodcast!!!!!
Kane with a brilliant finish tonight as England win 2-0 . let's hope he takes his performance into the game on Sunday http://t.co/S6GPyhbC3N
Kane's teasing us with this shearer thing. Triple backflip into the corner flag at the stadium of light on Sunday
Missed the game, but awesome that Kane scored. Should help a ton for Sunday.  #Confidence
My son is walkin out with the ENG team tomorrow night,told him under no circumstances can he b holding hands with Kane,am I right 2 say that
Now I'm talking to my big sister and she's telling me that Kane's telling her he is going out on sat and I'm like yhhh I know with me
Pat Brisson, the agent for #Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane, said Tuesday he believes Kane is innocent of any crime ( Per @ESPNChiPowers)
Pretty sure Kane will interfere on Sunday in the Taker/Lesnar match and Taker wins then they have a rubber match and Les nar wins.
Sunday Supplement are honestly making out that Kane is one of the best strikers in the world.  He isn't even the best striker at Tottenham.
True. True. Very true. FALSE.  Go out and get some attacking help before you run Kane into the ground. #COYS  https://t.co/RVZg7rSVNk
Wahhh I forgot the 2nd goal was so pretty in the Final. Saad to Richards to Kane. #cryingforever
We are passing the ball well but no movement in the final 3rd, Kane was in our own half from defending in that attack!
Well done H its good to see you score again. like to see Kane and Son team up Hint Hint! keep going https://t.co/slm8vaprCN
When Ostrovsky, 33, finally addressed the charges dismissed, Kane did claim one victory Monday, a Pacific Standard partner site.
With Kane and Rooney seemingly forming a great partnership, it shows how great a signing Man Utd may have wanted to make #rooney #kane #mufc
no pace or creativity,defenders know how to play against kane and lloris has saved us too many times, 3rd week in a row with only 1 CF #THFC
we may be playing San Marino, but it's good to Kane get on the scoresheet

If Kanye West becomes president I may move to America.... So I could flee the country.
If Kanye West comes even close to winning the 2020 election, like 5th place or higher, I'm leaving the country for Canada
If Kanye West runs for president with a bit of luck he may just get assassinated #wecanonlyhope #letuspray
If you even remotely support anything Kanye West says I will say a prayer on Sunday for you and your ignorance

The scariest thing about Kanye West announcing his intention to run for president, is that some people may actually vote for the fool.
The world is going to end the day Kanye West is elected pres or tomorrow

I may never tweet about anything other than Kanye West ever again
I may not always agree with Kanye West, but that's a guy who, if he wants something, he's going to do all that he can to get it.
I may not speak too highly of Kanye West the person, but I am a fan of his music. It is possible to separate actions and work.
I remember in the 6th grade Dylan and I could sing every word to Kanye West's Heartless
I want Charlie Wilson and Kanye West to perform at my wedding and/or my 25th birthday party #Bound
I want to go see Kanye West on the 25th!!

'Last Friday Night' does not depict a healthy relationship with intoxicants. do not invite Katy Perry to your parties
I may hate me some Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, and Katy Perry but I love some Carrie Underwood because she know how to stay in her lane.
I really fucks with @cthagod and @djenvy .. Every Friday they play Katy perry last Friday night (TGIF) @breakfastclubam #TGIF
Only saviour is it was "against all odds" Now it's Katy Perry ... Monday morning getting worse
Somebody tell Katy Perry she doesn't look like Elizabeth Taylor. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not after half a day in a make up chair. Stop it.

@BXHXLD @artschooldrop I'll never forget you getting in an argument over Kendrick's black on black crime stuff in the club on a friday night
@Phoenvvx sure. Even Kendrick lost it towards the end of his Black Friday freestyle ( and this isn't me hating).
@SmittyGotNoHoes it's the coaching fault how is Kendrick not rushing the passer anymore on 3rd down ? Like Cox not our best option
@yomilo when we make that restaurant the picture of the ruby yacht beating Kendrick shall hang on the with our 1st dollar
Both dope songs but Kendrick has a message Future just goin dumb on auto tune  https://t.co/pqIhnFhFNR
Cole clearly said him and Kendrick aren't doing anything. So whatever he's dropping in February isn't what you think.
Damn dawg you weak ass niggas are really berating Kendrick. https://t.co/svYNcP7SqN
Honestly only bad thing I can say about the Kendrick album were the roll out of singles and what ones were picked 1st
How cam called obj over to him was just as disrespectful when Kendrick called out Cole 1st and last name on control and not everybody else
I fucks with Kendrick, but March Madness deserve to be our national anthem it's that cold
I'll hate on Kendrick all fucking day but that Black Friday freestyle is fucking legendary
I'm thinking it's either some solo shit or that Kendrick collab  https://t.co/P7y253rFzw
J. Coles verse in Black Friday was kinda disappointing but Kendrick killed it
Kendrick made sure iggy wasn't going to steal his bars when he snapped on Black Friday.
Kendrick said a whole bunch of nothing on that Black Friday something but you people say e be verse of the moment.
Kendrick the GOAT twitter "All females hoes" twitter  https://t.co/YXd3f1psRg
Kendrick's "u" and The Social Experiment's "Sunday Candy" are two songs that make my allergies act up when I hear them.
Kendrick's 2015 album may be important but it's not especially listenable. Future sounds like a guy playing with a microphone at Best Buy.
Let's be honest how many of ya sat down and listened to Kendrick's To Pimp a Butterfly? Cause I skimmed through it once and turned it off
Lmao I thought Kendrick was about to play Black Friday and I freaked out but nah
My first time hearing "Black Friday" was yesterday.. Kendrick and Cole both murdered it
Pink Friday set the standard for all Rap albums. If it wasn't for Nicki y'all wouldn't have them mediocre bitches like Kendrick and Drake.
Rather have that than the colab with Kendrick.  https://t.co/mcK2fKYxDe
Someone commented on Black Friday by Kendrick and Cole and wrote, "Once I saw these niggas looking homeless I knew fire was on the way." Lol
That August Alsina album is dope. Most artists' sophomore album isn't as good as the first (*cough* Kendrick *cough*) but this joint fire
This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think that ever since the Grammy's snubbed Kendrick the first time,they just throwing awards at him
Wale don't do this man. I fux wit you but you 2nd or 3rd tier in this rap game bro. Kendrick is miles in front, he'll answer in time #TDE
While we're on the topic.... J. Cole &gt; Kendrick   As far as Black Friday is concerned... Go debate ya fat aunt who only wears elastic pants
Why can't Kendrick rap on every song like he did Black Friday. Old Kendrick is better.
Yo it's been 2 and a half weeks since Kendrick's Black Friday dropped and I still haven't fully understood all his lyrics yet...
if you think Kendrick's Black Friday was better than J. Cole's, you can block me now
rap mon and suga sampling swimming pools by kendrick is by far the weirdest shit i have seen

@kev_tee23 @GeezMariee fuck just take her to the Compton swamp meet and may get lucky and run into Kendrick
@sxmmo don't know the order, but top 3 albums are from Kendrick, The Weeknd &amp; Bieber (Taylor Swift 4th)
@xoGentlewoman kendrick's to pimp a butterfly is probably my fave album of the year alongside HBHBHB and sound &amp; colour is a close 2nd
Another one in February too?!?! Ohhh plz be with Kendrick!!!!
As of right now it's Drake, Kendrick, and Cole.  That 4th spot is still available...or they might be the Holy Trinity.
Black Friday by J. Cole and Kendrick is soooo good and the ending of J. coles version had me dead
Black Friday by Kendrick is probably the best song I've ever heard
Black Friday is one of the best songs Kendrick has done
Black Friday x Kendrick and J Cole oh my goodness I can't stop playing it
But I think the weekend or Kendrick may possibly get album of the year
But tomorrow is my day off so I'll be alright (Kendrick voice)
Can we just talk about how much Kendrick slaughtered that Black Friday track? Sheeeeeeeesh
Can't wait for February Kendrick and Cole about to kill it
Can't wait for the picture of Kendrick holding 11 Grammys to surface so I can be like "this is for the people in March calling TPAB trash"
Charles Hamilton "Black box" is on Friday only if he was focused he would have been up there with cole and Kendrick
Cole &amp; Kendrick need to make that joint album! #Fire   Kendrick Lamar &amp; J. Cole - Black Friday  https://t.co/0wFWzLbhbH

Do anybody else agree that Cole and Kendrick did better on each other song with the black friday
Earl tomorrow then Kendrick the day after!!!!!' CANT HANDLE
Everyone should have Kendrick's album 1st or 2nd he killed that shit
Finally the Grammies give some more attention to the artistry of hip-hop. Good job Kendrick on having the 2nd most nominations ever. (11)
Glad Kendrick got that album of the year nom but The Weeknd though? C'mon man... #fb

I can't wait to invade these Wal-Mart's on December 22nd with Kendrick's XXL cover.
I could listen to the black Friday songs Kendrick and cole dropped all day man fr
I don't fuck with Kendrick like that at all, but he slayed this: https://t.co/Y8TMOFjrfd
I enjoy Kendrick for rhymes and performance. That 2nd part makes the first hazy for many, I think.
I hope these chats about Cole n Kendrick dropping in Feb are true...
I know y'all band wagoning j Cole and Kendrick if you thought Black Friday was fire
I know yall listened to Kendrick x Black Friday. So tell me with a straight face J Cole just as good @SameolDuece @Jarrick3Real @Young_Twaun
I laughed at the end of Kendrick's black friday
I love Kendrick's 2nd album as much as anyone but it doesn't compare to Good Kid Mad City
I love refinding amazing songs. In 9th grade( now im a junior) i loved SOO many amazing rap songs like Memories back then with Kendrick, bob
I may need to fact check, but I'm pretty sure that Kendrick is only the 2nd rapper to have his 1st 2 albums nominated for AOTY.
I posted on FB for the first time in years to only post links from the Black Friday songs from J.Cole and Kendrick lmao
I purchase Kendrick, Cole, August, Lito, Drake etc. they give you records that mean something, that relate to life
I sat in the dark for two hours and listened to kendrick
I still can't wrap my head around Kendrick and j cole's Black Friday it's too godly
I wanna go to the kendrick concert tomorrow but thats like a death trap
I want to go see Kendrick tomorrow
I was so said when I heard this ,it's two separate song ,by j Cole and Kendrick but use each others beats https://t.co/YRnuIayeQP
I'm only just hearing Black Friday..... Kendrick u freed me
I'm pretty sad that this is the first time I've heard Black Friday by Kendrick and J.cole
I'm still not over Black Friday with Kendrick and J Cole tbh
I'm still not over Kendrick's "Black Friday" freestyle. Lyrically up there with the "Control" verse. I said it.
I've been listening to J Cole's and Kendrick's Black Friday.I mean even if it isn't a collaborative project, let the niggas drop some fire.
Idk how on earth I'm going to get through April 14th without Kendrick and Oscar
If I could make the Logic and Future shows in March and a Kendrick show, I'd be content.
If Kendrick and Cole drop they're album in February watch Drake drop his a week after just to kill there buzz. That would smart marketing
If you haven't heard Black Friday by Kendrick and J Cole I suggest for you to listen to it.
If you haven't heard black Friday by jcole and Kendrick. Please allow your ears to have orgasms.
If you like rap and don't like Kendrick's "Black Friday", news flash: you don't really like rap
J Cole an Kendrick. L drop their heat on February 16 the same day of my birthday HINTHINT COUGHCOUGH that'll be a good b day present.
J.Cole &gt; Kendrick Lamar, biased opinion Kendrick is growing on me and the February album if true will be lit

Kendrick is on top of the game in my opinion. His bars are incomparable to any others right now. Black Friday is fire
Kendrick is reinventing the rap industry, he may be not winning as much as other rappers, but shit that music is fucking worth it. TPAB
Kendrick is the most talented rapper alive, Black Friday is exhausting in a good way like HOW how do u just keep switching up like that
Kendrick killed this beat better but I see you j.cole!  https://t.co/wYv4TBHqER

Love in the dark Black Friday (Kendrick) What's up Work Church  https://t.co/k7M4Ne2ZV7
Mannn, Kendrick may be better than Future, but I would rather listen to Future am day of the week.
Maybe because of this he may compliment Kendrick if they both did a collab album &amp; might fight to hold his own might be good
Mick Jenkins may be the best rapper alive and this is strong consideration of Kendrick,King Los,Ab-Soul,Big Sean,Vince Staples and others.
Mj had 12, Kendrick with 11 on an album our culture didnt love at 1st, although grammys are hit &amp; miss in hip hop hes influencing people
Not sure how to feel about Kendrick's sons coming up. Inspiration is beautiful, but c'mon fammm.
Pieces from the 1st Traci Lynn Fashion Jewelry  Show I went with Kalynn M. Kendrick , yes Ladies the Jewelry is definitely On Fleek!
Playing Kendrick's Black Friday in the sauna to sweat more
Really hoping Kendrick's next album has at least 10 tracks where he snaps like he did on his black friday freestyle
Revenge of the Dreamers 2 comes out this Friday. J Cole and Kendrick collab album comes out in February.  Truly what a time to be alive
Selling Day for a Night Free Press Passes Ft. Kendrick Lamar. $40 for 2 day pass. Kendrick performs tomorrow at 9:30 p.m. Hmu if interested
Still listenin to Kendrick's Black Friday...idk if a joint project with him is a good idea for anybody lol...on another level...
Super-happy for Kendrick today but the reality is he'll lose 90% of those nominations in February and then it's back to hating the Grammys.
That wasn't even the day I wanted to go most and it was insane can't wait for Kendrick tomorrow
The Black Friday remixes by Kendrick and Cole are the exact reason I can't wait for their joint album
The way J-Cole and Kendrick are teasing the world for the their collab album, with Black Friday is just faaaaya!!!
There is going hard and than there is Kendrick in Black Friday.
Top 5 MC's right now gotta be Kendrick, Cole, Rocky, Big Sean, and an unfilled 5th spot. Knights on the Mic.
Wale's content may have similarities to TPAB's but the difference is Kendrick executes it EXTREMELY better
Was listening to Kendrick's "Black Friday" and I'm pretty sure it took my Call of Duty online to a entirely new level..
We get a 2nd Christmas in February with Kendrick and Coles collab album
Welp I got 3/5 right for AOTY, Kendrick deserves it but it may come down to Taylor or The Weeknd
Why am I just now hearing J Cole and Kendrick tracks Black Friday... Both of them are fire
Why do I feel like i'm falling in love with Kendrick for a 3rd time? This is weird. The dude just seems so happy and finally at peace.
Y'all can't keep comparing jcole &amp; Kendrick , that's like the moon &amp; the sun ...
You can listen to Kendrick when he rap about real shid...but can't listen to august alsina when he sings bout real shid......funny
You can't tell me you like Kendrick or J. Cole but haven't listened to the Black Friday songs they put out
You kinda look the same Kendrick look a little different lol  https://t.co/D6kwHIL4iq

If Kris Bryant can hit 3 more HRs by the end of the season, he will be the 2nd best rookie in Cubs history behind Kerry Wood if not the best
If it ain't broke don't fix it, why move kris Bryant up to 3rd when he's hitting as good as he has all season at 5

#MichaelJackson died in the care of Conrad Murray a whole #83Minutes before Murray called 911.The TRUTH coming Thurs  http://t.co/RYdgqKF7no
#USOpen Anderson beat Murray in the 4th round. It's Murray's earliest Grand Slam exit in 5 years
@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
@SkySportsTennis it's a joke! Troicki v young into a 5th set and on Sky go we are forced to watch Murray walking into the practice court???
@cake_sports Haven't seen it yet. Caught end of Murray loss lights and interview. SVP is that dude though. 1st show.
@maxcouch @roryjiwani @Alex_0wen @DanBarberTF @Tennisratings Murray will never win a slam again unless he changes. 2nd serve a joke
Anderson absolutely killed Murray in the 4th set tie break 7-0 to win the match. How embarrassing for Murray
Andy broken to start the 3rd set; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time. Murray's so done. #USOpen
Beginning to worry Murray may be stuck on two grand slams for the rest of his career.
Booo, Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set. It's not as if he's playing bad, Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here. #USOpen
I LOVE how aggressive both Serena &amp; Venus are being off the 2nd serve return. Murray would lose this match! @cbfowler @bgtennisnation
If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.
Murray about as dead as the aliens in Independence Day on July 4th in #America. They die in the movie either way but worse on the 4th. #Dead
Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong. How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
Murray been broken in the 3rd. Unreal. Straight sets loss would make my day
Murray blew it! Just couldn't handle Anderson's first serve in the 4th set.
Murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd #USOpen Looking angry and frustrated
Murray is beaten before the QF of a Grand Slam for the first time in five years. Anderson, magnificent throughout, took 4th set tiebreak 7-0
Murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. Sloppy along with a brilliant shot from Anderson denies the break. #USOpen
Murray with a splendid array of swear words at the end of the 2nd set. Sitting there with the commentator having to say, "sorry.  sorry."
Murray's in major crisis here - 5 - 1 down in the 2nd set after losing the 1st! scenes!!
Murray's serve broken in 1st service game 2nd set. I'm not watching any more. He does my  head in at times doing everything the hard way!

Woeful start to the 3rd from Murray. Think this is lights out for him.
15-30 on Murray's serve, but the Scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces.  Andy up 4-3* 3rd set.
4th set point in this game and  challenge called in. Anderson 2-0 sets. Murray much more promising at the end of the 2nd. He's not out yet!
@Betweenthehedge @VivianJo1 @cosmosmom1952 Don't you just love them to pieces?!?! Murray is my 3rd. I can only handle one at a time tho. lol
@BrainGameTennis If Murray takes 3rd set I think he'll win
@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.
@GolfYeezus @S1NGH7 yeah Murray 1st/2nd, sproles for the 3rd down td lol
@Joannalangfield Concerned. If Murray can win this 3rd set, I think/hope he can win the match :)
@JoshCollacchi to be honest, I'd let Murray run it every time, even on 4th and 35, than let Trey throw.
@KCChiefs_58 well, I think KC may have a good QB for the future in Murray.
@LewisKing__ @LouisWhyman @DCBlueStar I'm saying Murray was good but it great. Randle and dmc are just as good if it better. CM is 4th RB
@Linda_Grace74 I can't see the tennis either, gutted I never sat the football but it looks like it's sky again for Murray?
@MurrayBarnett thanks for hosting us Murray. Had a great time. Good luck for the cup. May the best team win. They usually do.
@ScottSFTC I wish I had seen your picks earlier after the day I had!!! Murray won 3-0 so your 2nd pick didn't hit. GL
@SeanTierneyTSS If Murray comes back well, he'll be the 2nd/3rd best D maybe Johnson. I'd want him for the Leafs for sure.
@SkySportsTennis it's why I love tennis. One minute looks like murray is down and out. Next minute anything is possible! C'mon @andy_murray
@SkySportsTennis the later i stay up the better...c'mon Murray!
@andy_murray knows how to wring my nerves! Talk about tension and it's only the 1st set :-) Brilliant stuff. Behind you all the way Murray!
@andy_murray wins 3rd set to get back into the match but @kevinanderson18 still leads 6-7 3-6 7-6 Murray has won 8 times from 2 sets down.
@kevinanderson18 you're serving big tonight, you'll play Murray on Monday and you'll struggle to get your first serves in play.
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!
@serialsockthief Definitely although I think if Murray does enough to win the 4th set he'll go on and win it.
@tgawd____ trash OL? Theyve looked excellent so far. Trash RBs?J-Stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season, 2nd only to Murray
@usopen Ofcourse! Looking forward to Murray's 4th round game against the big-serving Anderson. A potential 5-setter. #usopen #nightshift
A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?
A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.
Anderson beats Murray in the 4th round #USOpen2015 excellent game. #WellPlayed. http://t.co/Z2dFO2XQCs

Anderson takes a toilet break. He's up 2 sets but doesn't really have the momentum. Murray finished 2nd set stronger.
Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing.
Bellucci played a great 3rd set but Murray was just too good. He advances into week 2 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 7-5 win #TeamMurray #usopen
Best of luck @kevinanderson18 on 4th rd @usopen vs Murray! Wish I was there to cheer you on. Go Illini!
Biggest game of the match. Even bigger than the 3rd set tie-break. Murray simply had to hold. Please Andy.
But! Murray takes the tie break in the 3rd set and we've got GAME ON! http://t.co/tzKVTmQMkL
Call on the field is reversed as the Aggies came up short of the 1st down. Murray and crew will go for it.
Christine Michael is probably the 6th best RB in the division behind Murray, Mathews, Sproles, Morris, and Mostert.
Come on @andy_murray!! Tempted to make my way across to Flushing Meadows on Wednesday if Murray comes back to win here! #USOpen
Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis
Crew gets a fumble at the 4, Murray and the O can't punch it in. Kick a FG to make it 17-7. May be Murray's team now. Crew has been awesome.
Get in!! Murray take the 3rd!! (Anderson leads 7-6 6-3 6-7) #USOpen2015
Good straight sets win for Murray last night hope he kicks on from here and good chance of winning the #USOpen for a 2nd time
Got Murray at 7. Surprised but my cousin took Antonio Brown at #2. Rodgers fell to me in the 2nd. Stashed Foster away in the 7th. Love it.
Great Sunday Sesh at Redcliffe on the Murray today!! Beautiful weather for it. It was also Wilsons first gig to... http://t.co/a7aWtpHQsl
Happy 6th birthday to Murray who celebrates with us @Falkirkbairns today! We hope you, your friends and family enjoy your special day!
Happy Labor Day @ChadMMurray and @sarahroemer. Hope you enjoy baby Murray's 1st Labor day. Much Love to yall and baby Murray
I can't believe Murray has to play on the junior varsity court in the 4th round of the U.S. Open
If this goes all the way to the 5th.... Odds lie with Murray to take the match. #usopen #SSTennis
It may only be the round of 16, but holy cow! Don't tell that Anderson and Murray! Incredible match! 3hrs and 40min so far. #USOpen2015
Just as I say how good Anderson has been, Murray goes 3-1 up in the 3rd. Of course. #USOpen
Last two service games started well only to be whittled away at. Still, Murray wins second game on the trot to make it 3-5 in 2nd set.
Lets go Andy! Murray wins the 3rd set, down 1-2. #usopen #andymurray
Morning from #Woking where it is a dull start but hoping for sun to break through later. Couldn't stay up for end of Murray's match. :(
Mr. Murray gave me some really great life advice in the 7th grade and I was too much of a little douchebag to appreciate it.
Murray 6-3 6-2. First set 50mins, 2nd 34. Bellucci's fine start, belief, fading fast, Murray steady with flashes of his best, like SP pass.
Murray breaks again!! Back to back breaks in the 3rd set, Game face on!
Murray d. Bellucci 6-3 6-2 7-5. Much better play from the start compared to his last match. Very tamed match. Into 4th round. #USOpen
Murray does well to hold. 5-4 to Murray. Anderson to serve to stay in the 3rd set #USOpen
Murray gets the break he needed. Even's things in the 3rd. Anderson has 3 sets to fail if Murray hopes to win.
Murray has decided to only hit Aces. Already 4 and it's just his 2nd game !!
Murray has this. He may not have it at the moment but I'm not worried #USOpen #murray
Murray is outshooting St. Mary 6-4 in the 21st minute, but still no score.
Murray must must must win this game on Anderson serve to turn the tide and give him something for the 3rd to build on #USOpen
Murray now holds to love and he levels the 4th set at 5-5. Pressure straight back on Anderson. His longest match at the Open #USOpen
Murray on the verge of being Scottish again for the 2nd time in a week.......
Murray seals the 2nd set 6-2 #USOpen2015 #USOpen #easy
Murray stays alive! He wins the 3rd set 7-6! #USOpen #tennis
Murray struggling at moment but I think he'll come strong in 3rd &amp; 4th set to take it to decider #USOpen2015
Murray takes the 3rd set, game on!
Murray will get to watch the second half of Scotland v Germany. Get him pumped for his own battle.  https://t.co/0tpTX3V6uM
Murray with another huge 1st down run, 26 yds
Murray's form has been tremendous this year ... a win tonight would've seen him reach 60 victories in a season for just the 2nd time
Piers Newbery : @piersnewbery:  Murray breaks back in the 3rd, huge roar, crowd loving it. Not sure Lamps expe...... http://t.co/HRAiTsXvzq
RESULT: Andy Murray def Thomaz Bellucci 6-3, 6-2, 7-5. Murray advances into the 4th Round to play Kevin Anderson #USOpen
Rare i walk away from a match but big day tomorrow so i need my sleep. Shout loud Murray fans #BacktheBrits #USOpen
Really great match this now. Anderson is going for broke on every Murray 2nd serve, and Murray is winning most rally points now. #USOpen2015
Say hello to Vince and April! Our first ever Murray's Students of the Month!  Check out our blog to read all about... http://t.co/MFp6RXVOo3
So in order for #Raiders to beat the #Bengals Derek Carr has to have a perfect game, He needs to RUN for 1st downs. Murray needs to shine
Staying up 2 watch the Anderson v Murray match was so worth it. Only missed some of the 4th set when my eyes couldn't anymore!
Sumlin says he put Kyler Murray in for Kyle Allen during 1st half as a "change of pace quarterback." That pace: Fast. Murray has some wheels
Superb from Anderson. Good fight from Murray as always. 2nd serve just ain't strong enough imo.
The WAM (Write Around the Murray) Book Festival starts today at the Albury Library/Museum and goes until sunday... Go check it out!!!
There you go! Murray breaks back in the 3rd. Can he make another comeback here? Looooong way to go! #USOpen2015 #@usopen
This Murray vs Anderson match is great. 4 hour match and it's still in the 4th set.
Two aces for Murray who holds for 4-3. Another Brit on court -- @JoKonta91 just starting v @Petra_Kvitova 2-1 to Czech 1st set on Ashe
WE HAVE THE BREAK ! Murray breaks Bellucci to 30. Serving for the 1st set at 5-3 !
We're going to a 4th set!! Murray just dominated that tiebreak, wins it 7-2. He's pumped up now!! #USOpen2015 #Murray
What an effort from Murray in that 2nd set. Got to take the momentum from the last few games into the 3rd. #USOpen
With an ace, Murray takes the 3rd set 7-6(2)  but still trails Anderson 1-2.
Wow!! Just waking up to this. Saw it up to 2-1 Murray in 3rd set. Anderson was unbelievable; incredible win. https://t.co/Txqzz5PUrr
don't want to leave during the middle of the Murray match, but I don't want to be dead for my 8:30 tomorrow #decisions
you don't usually get a tough opponent till week 2, Murray's had 3 in the 1st week. Whoever heard of having to play 7 top 40 players to win

@ARnews1936 @RebelMouse @CharlesDuxbury Maybe because Muslims say Denmark will be 1st European Muslim country. They want the world.

@Independent That may explain the problem we're having with Muslims fundamentalists.
@JOYOURPAPARAZZI If I can get one Muslim to agree killing of Muslims is the responsibility of Muslims. I may help.
@LeoWillner in regards to the masses of refugees this is crazy. Also when Muslims may take Greece. Real world worst case scenarios are...

@ShounenStrawHat it's a disgrace that the game came out in japan on 28th March smh,naruto games come out within a week worldwide
@YeahItzJay Maybe Gaiden characters? 7th Hokage Naruto would be suuuuper lit. And Boruto comes out tmrw so maybe thats it
@YungTracFone to you I guess .... Naruto has the 4th hokage jutsu and even furthered it rather then perfected.
@_Tjayy Oh, I remember that one. Pretty good. The one that's your 2nd favorite is my fav from the original Naruto.

My shift was cancelled for tomorrow. Time watch Naruto and Cowboy Bebop all day. #Mylife

Naruto is like crack. I keep saying saying one more episode, until "Oh look, the sun." #NARUTO
Naruto may really be the child of God. Straight up healing the blind just like Jesus did .  #shippuden

I miss Niall so much he made me so happy on Saturday I felt at home and god I want to go back
I want to make a shirt with Niall's tweet and wear it every Monday
I was thinking about Niall and how he was really cute at 16 and then I remembered his 22nd birthday is in five days and I can't cope with it
I'm mainly just waiting on Cameron's on the 8th, Jack G's on the 10th &amp; then Niall's on the 13th
I'm phone is going to died so goodnight i will be back tomorrow if i have time see you guys tomorrow goodnight to Harry,Niall,Liam, Louis
Is it pointless for me to try to get a Niall follow? I may be part Irish but I swear I have no luck so I can't see it ever happening.
Looooong day. Can't wait to see Niall tomorrow :)
Louis and Harry love home Sunday roast. Liam loves curry, while Niall loves all the food in general
Louis was so cute when he was sat next to Niall at the last concert and he kept making him laugh and was all giggly with him
Luckily the boys don't have a show tomorrow, really hope Niall will feel better soon :(

What's this? - you may ask. It's a fan project for Niall's birthday!  Want to get noticed by Niall? Make a video! http://t.co/9i4KyBzj8l
Why is everyone talking about Niall's bday it's not until the 13th ok I have 8 more days until I panic bc he's 22
Why is no one talking about the fact that Niall's birthday is almost here. Or the fact the boys can drop the 5th album any day now
by tomorrow, my layout will hopefully consist of a selfie with Niall and otra fireworks fingers crossed people
do you know that moment when you stare at the sun and your eyes start to cry because it's so bright? that happens to me when i look at Niall

we don't get enough Niall in yellow, I don't like the color but he looks like the sun in it #MTVHottest One Direction
@MileyCyrus I dreamed about katy perry dragging Nicki's back for you on sunday and it was very fatal. I hope it's gonna happen
@Nicki_F @ThalesLives @scottedelman You may disagree Nicki, but the facts just don't support you. Nor does the vote by all of fandom.
@TMZ Miley may act and be the way she is but she is a good person. Nicki is the one looking for fights anywhere. Embarrassing...
@itsbl0ndie I still think it was fake. I always thought Nicki to be the type to call you out on a random Tuesday, not at an awards show
@musicnews_shade azealia may not be the most famous rapper of all time but sadly, nicki's songs are in billboard for her physique not talent
@nice_feminist she may be a """"problematic fave"""" but there's NO reason for her to be getting dragged just cuz Nicki said some shit
@rayshellbox Kasi nga diba may prejudice pa rin about black entertainers? Also Miley says that Nicki keeps pulling the race card--
@spectralpixie nicki can't even get her 3rd album to go gold lmfao  Nicki copies off Kim's OLD shit, Kim was the first female with --
A no no, Kanye announces he's running for president, and nicki gets crazy with Miley all in the the same night.. It's Sunday wtf
A woman called Nicki a wee bitch and spat because she sat down in front of her on the 11
All Nicki said was "what's good" like c'mon now we get it she a bad bitch ok
And tomorrow Nicki is going to be seen as "a raging angry black women" for calling Miley out of something that she is GUILTY for
Do you guys remember that not too long ago Nicki was like one of the most hated artist.. During her Pink Friday album
I think Nicki made an ass out of herself last night. 1st you call the VMA's racist, 2nd then you perform and accept an award at the VMA's
I'm over here tryna do this work before classes start tomorrow and Nicki is being the shady bitch queen she is and I just lost all focus
If Nicki didn't have her ass, she'd be shorter when she sat down.
If you think Nicki's ass is more than 1/8th real you are fuuucked
Kanye and Nicki are the reason they may have to do away with award shows. YOU say it's about artists but you two always make it about YOU.
Literally 1st time I've ever watched the #VMAs. Miley called Nicki out on her CRAP, and I respect that. #sorrynotsorry #suckitupnicki
Lost some respect for Nicki after that. You may be a queen in the rap world but when u start shit at an award show u look like garbage #VMAs
Miley has no tits &amp; ass but Kim and Nicki may have the same botox injection expert and Kim ain't got shit to lose. https://t.co/EEjrWcrHzw
Miley is the 8th most hated person in America, idk why y'all are acting like Nicki gets more hate than Miley
Nicki dead ass sat in our fAces and lied to us about meek. bye http://t.co/XTK1x0URvo
Nicki's butt is just too big like c'mon that's not even fun anymore like
So whats good Miley? @MileyCyrus ...lol Nicki with that fuck shit,we may as well make a song about it. Hit me up. I ghost write like Quentin
This ain't the 1st day I've ever called Nicki ignorant, fuck. I'm on and off w/ her. Its simple, &amp; I don't always like how she handle shit.
Why is Nicki always calling someone out on stage .. Bitch looks so trashy while Miley just sat there and took what she said with class
Yall act like Nicki really Finna mess up Taylor's moment ............for the 2nd time again. #VMAs
i want mildew clitoris off my tl i dont want her anywhere near nicki i dont want to see her rat ass ever again launch her into the sun
i'm tweeting this for the 2nd time, nicki needs to realize that people don't buy her music NOT BECAUSE SHE ISN'T "SKINNY AND WHITE"+
miley.. you better watch out for nicki backstage she may throw hands
tbh if tomorrow ppl start going after Nicki for what she said im gonna be pissed
@Iovemyths Watch: even tho that was Nicki responding 2 Miley putting her on blast 1st the media will make it out like Nicki picking a fight.
@Likeitornotmama @LILKIMQOR Its not... Nicki garnered the success she has today because of what her 2nd album entailed AND the look.
@Likeitornotmama @jda927 Lil Kim will be remembered as the 3rd/4th most successful female rapper. Nicki will/is the 1st. Numbers don't lie.
@LuxxSOCIAL @Raheem_TM it may have have gotten a higher score never denied that fact....but Nicki's album is STILL critically acclaimed. Lol
@NICKIMINAJ hey Nicki i was going to wish you happy independence on monday from Trinidad
@NICKIMINAJ hey Nicki, wish me luck on my first day tomorrow ? Lol
@NickiHunter happy humpday Nicki enjoy your Wednesday. Super love and miss you. Xoxo sweetpea
@TeaMasterT People need to full-stop stop using that for White characters. Full-stop. It's EXACTLY what Nicki criticized in the 1st place.
@ZeusBarker true, but she was flapping her gums, I'm glad Nicki sat her down. Someone needed to show her what she said was foul.
@anaaheartbeat @Aliina57 I'm watching the red carpet for Nicki mostly. They're gonna air the show tomorrow night so I might go to bed after
@barkycarly @aimeeorleans I feel like I planned my whole day wrong. I gotta get ready for class tomorrow. BUT I JUSR T WANNA WATCH NICKI
@e_jaculation but we mustn't forget that on the 7th day, God gave us a Nicki -- Miley take down of epic proportions. Rejoice my child.
@gregnisall @ENews Anaconda video got 19 million views in 24 hours, so whatever you may think of Nicki personally, she has a point.
@kiaspeaks oh. I may have been watching a marathon of who do you think you are on tlc. Wasn't paying attention to Twitter. Good for Nicki!
@mari_fminaj @THEQUEEN0FRAPI do not know, Pink Friday has the best song Nicki: Super Bass but the pinkprint has invincible like Anaconda
@n_embo @HogarthsWfield @ToastedOrange @jodiekins22 @OssettObserver Hullo Nicki! Thanks for invite, 'twas in the same venue last Wed!
@nicki_belles @Siggy116 @Jgrizam22 @bryantbreck I like the attitude Nicki. I'm gonna do it tomorrow. If I figure out how to do it lol
@wwe_qtd Bitch I'm Nicki you Iggy, I'm Romans Revenge you Black Friday, I'm Nickis Flawless you Lil Kim's Flawless, I'm Tink you Chanel West

Can't wait for tomorrow's headline: "Nicki beats the hell out of Miley at VMA after party"
Did you know that 'Nicki' was Trending Topic on Tuesday 1 for 4 hours in Las Vegas? http://t.co/LxJcwMPwbk #trndnl
Every day I thank god that Nicki recycled I Love You n put it on Pink Friday as Your Love
Everyone came to the VMAs looking boring or like trash (from what I see so far), and then Nicki showed up looking like a sun goddess.
Everyone in my feminist studies class was team Nicki AND the Mitski tinydesk was released today WHAT A MONDAY !!!!
I CAN'T WAIT to see Nicki at the VMA'S tomorrow
I bet Nicki has like a 3rd of the industry shaking in their boots. Plus the Barbz will drag if anyone comes for her.
I can not tell you how many times I have watched the video of Nicki calling out Miley since Sunday night
I could have sat on Nicki's ass tonight
I feel like so much happened on the VMAs.  Kanye, Taylor, Nicki and Miley, Miley released new music.. The news is gonna be CRAY tomorrow.
I have a feeling that Nicki's performance at the VMAs  will be the only good one tomorrow
I hope Nicki attends the Givenchy show Friday.
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/oyey81EYQ5 Nicki Minaj - Dear Old Nicki with lyrics - Pink Friday
I love Nicki and Miley and may need to call in sick tomorrow because of it
I may not love all of nicki's music but she is queen
I may watch the VMAs just to see Nicki's performance but dassit
I start school tomorrow and I'm only going because I don't want Nicki to be mad at me
I used to bump Nicki aalllll the time in middle school. Pink Friday was my fav
I want Nicki to fight Miley on a national awards show so bad and tonight may be the night
I'll set my DVR to record the encore so I can watch Nicki's performance tomorrow.
I'm Team Nicki but I would never openly say something bad about Taylor Swift because I think she may have snipers on retainer.
I'm gonna go buy a canvas tomorrow n paint Nicki dragging MILEY thru the mud
I'm gonna watch Nicki's opening tonight then watch the rest tomorrow
It's only the 5th day of school and I already don't wanna go but nicki wants me to so I'm going
Last night I unfollowed anyone hating on Kanye or Nicki you may remove yourself from my life goodbye
Maja is Nicki to April's Miley right now. April is inspecting a candle and Maja has the EYE on her. #whatsgood
Meek Mill really dated Nicki &amp; thought.. I'MON TOP OF THE WORLD. Thats what Love does to you man
My boy Biebs made the greatest comeback, the bae Big Sean won his 1st vma, Nicki dragged Miley to hell &amp; Kanye SLAYED everyones lives! #vmas
Nicki better release a raunchy vid for trini Dem girls so it can get her 1st grammy
Nicki came from Dubai today so she can perform with Beyonce tomorrow. Feeling myself and Flawless remix.I'm not ready http://t.co/SsM1bi8Iz7
Nicki did that for white media Idgaf . Nicki may act like she don't give af but she cares what the media thinks
Nicki fighting all the rich flat ass divas 1st Taylor swift now miley cyrus
Nicki getting hood just then gave me so much motivation to go to school tomorrow and get good grades and go to college I'm so alive
Nicki had the most consecutive weeks in the Top 10 by a female artist with 'Pink Friday'. http://t.co/al6op9AXC4
Nicki is FED UP! When she 1st came out she was bashed for her creativity, her body, her music. Now her opinions. I don't blame her.
Nicki is a great woman I don't care what you say. I may don't like her music a lot but she's very intelligent.
Nicki is so hot and out of all the fine qualities she has, her teeth just may be my fav one. Not her butt, but her teeth.
Nicki is the most talked about tonight and will be tomorrow. No doubt!
Nicki is the only reason my HW gets done tbh.  https://t.co/hyzutcbTuT
Nicki is truly a loving and forgiving God, may we all show the same mercy she has shown to taylor to those who have wronged us. Amen.
Nicki may be a black woman but you're forget shes a RICH BLACK WOMAN!
Nicki may not be a vocalist but she sure doesn't sound a mess when she sings  https://t.co/MumZ7ZKK8c
Nicki my fav, she slaying everyone and they momma' sat the VMAs, God bless
Nicki needs to take a pic with Fifth Harmony tomorrow.
Nicki's drag at the VMA's blessed my Monday
Okay if Justin, Nicki, Demi, the weekend and zayn are performing I'ma have to have a 36 inch sew in tomorrow cuz my weave coming out 2night
Overall...tonight reconfirmed my love for nicki and why I never went back to side bangs after 7th grade
Pink Friday is Nicki's best.  And the Pink Print is a sloppy mess.
Pretty sure Nicki's ass is the 8th wonder of the world
Professor: "read 8 chapters by Friday" Me: @ Nicki I hope you know I'm doing this for you
Remember the times we used to fast forward songs to Nicki's parts? Now she'll slay with a 3rd album out. Onika gurl. I love it.
So basically tomorrow Nicki gonna beat Miley's ass, Bieber gonna get a hair cut, and Kanye's campaign posters are going up everywhere #VMAs
Taylor and Nicki performing together may be the best thing
The only head line I wanna see about nicki tomorrow tbQh https://t.co/ofRlYK0ksL
The only reason I'm going to school tomorrow is BC I can't fail nicki
They girls still didn't get a selfie with Nicki n I was actually hoping for that more than the award. May the manips continue to rise smh
What a great weekend. First Drake was in the 'Ville Saturday then Nicki went for Miley's life tonight. What a time to be alive
What makes me sad is how tomorrow morning, the media is gonna portray Nicki as the stereotypical "angry black woman" &amp; make Miley the victim
When Nicki came into the game Bey was working on her 4th solo #1 album after selling millions, so for Nicki to share the same stage is a lot
Why do y'all want Nicki to be pregnant so bad like maybe around the 7th album but she's literally still in her prime.
Y'all was gna be mad at Nicki anyway. She just stole all the headlines for tomorrow, keep fuming bitches! New Queen of the VMA's.
Y'all, she may have made a pop album, but Nicki can kill almost anyone in this industry right now. Gun to the head of everybody.
after the VMAs last night, Nicki gave me the courage to stand up against my math teacher who wrongfullyy marked me absent last thursday
cue the mountain of thinkpieces about nicki's "aggression" and "internalized misogyny." looking forward to tomorrow.
hi Nicki u famous n I know, but ama keep it short. I love u dearly, though u n d world may think am crazy cos De say I write blindly.

when taylor joined Nicki I just sat there like.....
yeah i love Nicki and yeah Miley may have said something but Miley has a point, journalists always manipulate what is said, Nicki just
I think at this juncture I may like Queens of The Stone Age more than I like Nirvana. tending bar @124Rabbit tonight if you'd like to discus

Okay, so Paper Towns. Super super uncomfortable with the black character wearing a confederate flag shirt. It may have been in the book, but
This John Green's Paper Towns nonsense is just a recycling of the Little Boxes complaints of the 1960's: the original 1st world problem.
To whom it may concern, Paper Towns is on the stupidest movies I have ever seen, don't see it, for real
Watched Paper Towns on Saturday and I'm still very disappointed with the movie

How can you not root for Paul Dunne tomorrow? With all the mini tours I didn't think there were amateurs capable of contending at a major.
I can think of no finer thing than for an Irishman to win the British Open tomorrow. Good luck, Paul Dunne.
If Paul Dunne nails it tomorrow then the 1st placed pro should give him the cash #TheOpen2015
If Paul Dunne wins tomorrow I'm going to feel stupid for not betting a dollar on him #1500-1ods

Paul Dunne may be leading #TheOpen, but the race for the Silver Medal is far from over yet -&gt; http://t.co/jSYijrKs4i http://t.co/mUJP2UYNwp

Paul Dunne may only get a silver medal if he wins #TheOpen today but one suspects he won't need to worry about money for a while if he does.
Paul Dunne might get Ireland out of this economic crisis if he wins tomorrow! #TheOpen2015

Really torn on the final round tomorrow. I'd love to see Day finally get his major or for Paul Dunne to take it. Still want Spieth though
Should Paul Dunne of IRL finish the Open in 8th alone or better, he'll move to #1 in the SPWAR.  Same for Niebrugge if 5th alone or better.
So hope that, at the 18th, Paul Dunne makes that classic walk, knowing his putt could win The Open. What a story...

@PlayStation my PS4 died last night. I press the power button once it beeps, nothing happens. 2nd time beeps blue light comes on but nothing
@alexander01399 Ok, you may have to create an email that is shorter. The PS4 cannot handle that many characters for some reason. ^SO
C'mon 5 o'clock. I don't know if my PS4 is even downloading it or if it messed up. Gah. The suspense.
FUCK! Either i get bit or i turn off my fucking PS4! I ain't finna sit thru Lee's death for the 2nd time! #PS4share http://t.co/Pz9bPFnSMf
I'm gna play more tomorrow My PS3 controller battery is running low and u can't access the menu with the PS4 controller
Sent my PS4 scuf (that came broken in the mail) back for repairs in march and I haven't seen that shit since lmfao
Seriously considering getting a catheter fitted for optimum Metal Gear-ing all day Sunday. Failing that, might move the PS4 into the toilet.
my PS4 won't turn on. I may or may not have just lost everything on this piece of shit console.
@4JStudios even though tomorrow is Xbox1 and PS4 birthday for having minecraft it still should be fair to us because old gen was orginal.
@ATVIAssist Nah. Nothing wrong with it. Enjoyed the hell out of it on the PS4's beta. Keep up the great work. See ya November 6th :D
@AppaMJ bro c'mon get with the program PS4 is FTW #getitnow

@GarryAylott Yeah that's what I heard. Big Call of Duty player and all of the new maps come out for PS4 first so may move across.
@IllusionaryCake From what I understand the PC beta is the best, PS4 was good, ad Xbox is atrocious. Just got to level 2. After my 7th game.

@TimWelcomed Since there is a WWE Games group now on PS4 its a definite on PS4. May not even get it on x1 anymore now tbh.

@SNBarryDavis Also, the Red Sox do not have a challenge. They lost it in the 9th. This shouldn't be reviewed.
@TonyBarretTimes Red Sox getting battered by the Yankees at home it's 11-1 in the 3rd let's see if they fire the coach.
Did the Red Sox get bambino cursed heading into the 10th or what? Ball off glove, balk, wild pitch! #StillDontGetBalks
Eight-run 2nd inning for the Yankees and I'm just sitting here laughing at the Red Sox futility
I may not watch as much baseball as I did when I was younger, but there's nothing like the Yankees beating the Red Sox. #Classic
It's too bad the Red Sox didn't play this well in April, May, June, and July
Lol Red Sox just slid through 3rd base #out
Lost to the Red Sox? DAMN! C'mon Yankees, gotta keep beating up on the bottom feeders.
No. The Sox sucked in May.  But I wish the Red Sox had played like this in April-June. https://t.co/GdckgJTwRI
Now just need a run, an Andrew Miller 9th. and the hated Red Sox to come through.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Yankees took out their bats and began to wreck things in a 13-8 win over the Red Sox. http://t.co/rO4SMtCVxj

The Red Sox have completely fallen apart here in the 10th
This game is slipping away from the Red Sox.(And it's only the second inning)  NYY 6  BOS 1  Top of the 2nd
This is why the Red Sox are last place in the division. Poor defence in this 10th inning @BJsFans
well it may not be 1:30am, but the Red Sox lost 5-1, my little brother got carsick, and most importantly it's way past my bedtime.
2 Red Sox vs Blue Jays tickets for tonight's game. $100/each. Seats located behind first base. C'mon, don't be a cheapskate, BUY THEM!

Cherington may have been awful at free agent decisions, but he really did stack this Red Sox team with amazing youth.

Red Sox Rick Porcello and his 13K's and 2 unearned runs deserved a better fate. 3-1 Yankees in the 9th.

update: boss texted me to ask if I read the Rolling Stone article about GCJr's upcoming album #wow gonna cry when he retires in December
1st we are out and see Tayshaun Prince; @Casey_Hart14 has no idea who he is. 2nd I ask if he knows who Rousey is. "She that wrestlin bitch?"
@DavyWhite hope solo would make it to the 2nd round, then make Rousey's head explode with a death stare
@MarioMelchiot Rousey my dear, aim higher please. What's in it to waste time with a lizard shit 'runner'?   C'mon!
@ThaSJ101 wrestling guru @GregNecroBlack tells us why Rousey may not be the best UFC fighter ever https://t.co/oX8LaGLxiR @SportsTalkRT
@YahooSports I hope she beats her Ass.Rousey may be a converted guy for all we know. Truly, who cares!meh2490.
@_WhitePonyJr_ @Fugazi3011 @BenSotoKarass C'mon bro,you know Rousey isn't this hot
@bomani_jones the same Rousey fans tht scream Money May doesn't fight anyone, be the first to make an excuse as to why Rousey won't move up
@criscyborg I cant see Rousey fighting you Jan 2 because she's filming a movie after &amp; u would destroy her face. You deserve the big payday
@itstheryguy Rousey is not the Hero we deserve https://t.co/QcKApSjdqC
Cyborg and her management now calling for an April bout with Rousey ...lol..that didn't last long..fuck Cyborg already...
Don't tell me Rousey pulling a Mayweather and ducking fighters now. If Cyborg says she is down for December, make it happen.
Drake went in on meek again, it's all over! The only beating worse than this was the one Rousey delivered on Saturday
I don't want Rousey to be Captain Marvel! She may be strong enough but she's not pretty enough.
I love Meisha Tate,not a Rousey fan really,but I can't see the sense in a 3rd fight,it's gonna take a man to beat Ronda any time soon #UFC
I was finally warming up to a 3rd fight with Tate, and then the UFC goes and throws a Holm-run ball to Rousey. I don't get it.....
If you are a real MMA fan then UFC 194 will probably be the 2nd best card of the year I wouldn't put the Rousey card in the top 10
If you really think Rousey can be Mayweather I cannot take you serious at all.... This is a MAN fighting a WOMAN c'mon now
Rousey gon get schooled by the preachers kid, ya diggggg???  https://t.co/w4AWY52J9j
Rousey keeps running her mouth like the 3rd grader with a crush.
Rousey vs. Holm may be the biggest waste of a UFC card I've ever seen.
The Rousey Era is over. ROUSEY VS. HOLM January 2nd. @_HOLLYHOLM is just that much better. #UFC
The complete stupidity of the WWE constantly kissing up to Rousey when she has no say in if she can do Mania http://t.co/ldZ1qSo1Bj #RAW
Why is Rousey worried bout money may pay and I'm pretty sure they not even in the same tax bracket
- As I said immediately after her fight on Saturday, if you aren't behind Rousey at this point, it's envy.  If I... http://t.co/TCSxUYvkOl
@BeastmodeBox Considering her competition, it is like calling Wlad Klitschko the greatest heavyweight ever.  And Rousey is great, but c'mon
@CuseCarla Now you got me on the hunt for tickets event in Houston in Oct! Learn that Rousey arm bar! She needs a good challenger :)
@FloydMayweather u may b on Forbes but ur dumbass will go bankrupt eventually. Rousey is smart with her money unlike ur dumdass
@JMV1070 totally Rousey. Misha Tate took her to the 3rd round time last time and has gotten better
@MikeAndMike Rousey over Floyd everyday of the week and twice on Sunday. #BestFight
@RebsAllin @VegasRebs I think you may be underestimating the difference in boxing and mma. Rousey has all the advantage.
@RondaRousey It's gonna be hard enjoying Christmas knowing you're facing Rousey on 2nd January. Yeah, good luck with that one :D
@TheBlackTaco13 I'll get to see Rousey with you in Jan!
@WMMANews @MMARising I give  Rousey a lot of credit .. she want the first but she convinced so may that women can sell events
@WWENXT @BaronCorbinWWE I think that was faster win then the rousey fight on Saturday Night!
@chadnotweet Idk, seems like there r plenty of Rousey fans &amp; not just in the US. They may not be UFC fans but they'll pay big $$$ 2 see her.
@duresport @JESnowden Yes truly. Oh and Rousey really is a world class Judoka for all the comments about 3rd place. https://t.co/bnVYsWy6f0
@gma broke the story for @RondaRousey fight. As if Rousey couldn't get cooler, she is bringing MMA mainstream https://t.co/liMDO9XJho
@itsbktime but the difference is thay Rousey will fight whoever they throw at her and may picks his fights
@kaponofor3 Rousey and Stephanie may beat her to it but I know what you mean. She's a special talent.
@simonhead Rousey will just take her down and submit her. She may have to take a few punches to achieve this.
Always fun reading about Rousey's love for Pokemon and DBZ https://t.co/zQiGmV4zwR
And the wonder years and state champs are touring together and I get to see my first Rousey fight in Dec? I keep getting good news today
Dear Ms. Rousey, may I be your Pre-fight Fluffer? I promise I'll spike your testosterone &amp; make u win. Sincerely, Winky @RondaRousey #UFC195
December 5th could be the biggest UFC Card put together. Aldo &amp; McGregor, and Rousey as a co main event with her possibly fighting Cyborg.
Forbes highest paid women's athlete was Sharapova (11th yr straight) with 29.2 mil. Not hard to imagine Rousey topping that list one day.
Holm doesn't have enough MMA experience. She's going to get schooled. Rousey will simply demolished her. #UFC195  https://t.co/3544ac712v
Huh?! Holm isn't ready. Nothing in her previous fights makes me think she can beat Rousey. https://t.co/ygDbMXlYZe
I did laundry and didn't lose a SINGLE sock in the process and they moved the Rousey v. Holm fight to Nov 14. Today is a good day!!!!!
I need a big moment!  Something like a clutch moment! A Kobe in the 4th quarter!  A Ronda "Rowdy" Rousey 14 second knockout!
I would say him and Rousey are the hottest athletes in sports right now. SAVAGE  https://t.co/y4aCXXw0Aj
I'm on board with this. Feel bad for Miesha Tate, but looking at Rousey's dominance, the opponent doesn't matter. https://t.co/CBLF1GpBnk
If Aldo vs McGregor AND Rousey vs Cyborg are both booked for UFC 194 at Cowboy Stadium, I just have to be there! https://t.co/qGGiPhH8He
If McGregor and Rousey are scheduled on December 5 in Dallas, I will be there even if it's just by myself.
If anyone saw the UFC190 fight on Saturday, thenyou know Rousey was amazing!!! #UFC190 #RondaRousey
Meisha Tate MIGHT have lost to Rousey twice BUT is still deserving of a 3rd shot cause she earned it by grinding in the #UFC
My 62 year old father knew Rousey's fight date before me. Knew it was November but not date. He chimes in "oh yeah she fights Nov 14"
No one else may be able to sanction it, but Rousey vs. Mayweather (in some capacity) can work in #WWE
People always wanna be the next MJ, the next Rousey, I just wanna be the best me. I may go further than those so why limit myself?
Personally I would have loved to see Rousey vs Tate III, but Dana just announced... Rousey vs Holly Holm on January 2nd for #UFC195

Rousey fighting again in January. Gonna give Holm the benefit of the doubt and say she may make it past a minute.
Rousey firing back at May. Ha, love it.
Rousey is about to kill Hollie Holm in January. My guess is 16 seconds #UFC195 #bantemweightchampuonship
Rousey may be hot, but @LaurenPisciotta is the true bae http://t.co/0j3O93swwl
Rousey may not have the money that Floyd has, but people respect her way more.  https://t.co/ML43TY292L
Rousey obliterated Correia on Saturday! Is she the most dominant @ufc fighter ever? #ufc190 #RondaRousey
Rousey still going to KO her in the 2nd round  https://t.co/yLhe0oXfxS
Rousey vs Holm's on January 2. Holms has the best kicks of any ufc woman fighter. I'll give her at least 2 minutes with rousey
Rousey was right. You know you'll get beat, you just want the $ https://t.co/66YDin4uq8
Rousey would make may weather tap out.She would knock the 's of that fraud and fake . She loves the sport while the clown does it for the $
SIGH. Not really huge news in my opinion, but don't get me wrong I'm excited for Rousey &amp; Holm in Australia and seeing it sooner than Jan 2.
Sat for 3 hours in a restaurant to watch Rousey for 34 sec. &amp; I would do it again!!! #Rousey #BestFight @MikeAndMike @Espngreeny
So it's totally possible Rousey wins quickly in November (as usual) then headlines the Vegas January 2nd card. @danawhite

The @UFC moved up the @RondaRousey vs @_HOLLYHOLM fight to Nov. 14 in Australia. Rousey is always ready to fight #ufc193 #andStill
This December 12th card is going to be loaded - Im hoping we get Rousey - Tate, and maybe Fedor's return, along with Conor - Aldo #UFC
This died between Rousey and Mayweather; c'mon -- y'all athletes at the best in your sport. Rousey would win though. Can you say #WomenUnite
Watching the Rousey fight for the 10th time. This woman just motivates me dude.
Wow! Rousey vs. Holm moved to same night as Lawler vs Condit in Australia. #Albuquerque is going to be nuts Nov 14!  https://t.co/xZLxRIDBSg
Wow. If the UFC follows through with Co headliners of Mcgregor vs Aldo and the next Rousey fight both on Dec 5th... Im buying that fight!!!
at work still excited about Saturday's Rousey vs. Correia fight.
hey @GaryParrishCBS, I'm sure you know and may have already spoken about it, but Rousey accepted the marine's invite!!
@D_J_Harvey I think they may want a guy with back problems. Here, have Ryan Braun!
@MLB how does Ryan Braun get to step out of the batter's box after every pitch? Didn't we go over this in May?
Nobody wants to hear about that jerk anymore. Or Ryan Braun. Or any other cheating roid rage  jerk https://t.co/uqpwIjPTrL

Absolutely mortified and gutted that Sam Smith may be doing the new Bond song :(
Even though I'm not going to Sam smith tomorrow I would be hella disappointed bc he cancelled his show a day before :///
I WAS going to go to the Sam Smith concert tomorrow and find it insulting his people only gave 20 hour notice on the postponement.
I'm not entirely sure how I went from a crummy Sam Smith visual gag to aching existentialism but sudden Sun Kil Moon will do that to you
It sucks that I'm not even excited for the #SPECTRE theme tune debuting tomorrow, if it is Sam Smith it will really dampen my excitement.
Lol the same Sam Smith song has played 3 times already, if it plays for a 4th I will scratch someone's eyes out
No Nigerian Male artist can feature Sam Smith because they are afraid he may ask them for sex before the recording

Sam Smith hairline think it's Throwback Thursday everyday or some shit huh
Sam Smith may be the worst act on the radio
Sam Smith may have his fans but they certainly aren't the type of people that would watch Bond. What the hell have they done #SPECTRE
Sam Smith's doing next James Bond theme?  Could be 1st one where instead of intro with Bond shooting toward camera, he just shoots himself.
Sam smith is such a bad choice for the Bond song for Spectre like c'mon
Sam smith just came on. I sat down. I will not rave to that guy
Sam smith just canceled his concert for tomorrow. I'm soooooooo pissed

Jon Stewart cheating he helps Seth Rollins win that some cheap Monday Night Raw comes on tomorrow and I'm not going to be happy
Last night's #WWE #RAW, or, 'Seth Rollins and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day' http://t.co/jUUz5xYbBN http://t.co/VcROV1oGwX
May not watch #RAW tonight I was already tired of Seth Rollins when he retained against Brock. Just think how big he's head going to be now.
Payback is a bitch Seth Rollins  you've may have uh band the RKO at WrestleMania their is a RKO with your name on it
Seeing this dude 4 the 1st time, this Seth Rollins is a self assured SOB #WWERAW
Seth Rollins looks like the typical emo kid that shops at Pac Sun #SummerSlam
Seth Rollins may be a good superstar to date, but he is no legend! He needs to put that statue behind him and focus on Sting. #RAW
Seth Rollins may have broken John Cena's nose, but Cena won the match and made Rollins tapped out! @WWE #Smackdown #Cenation
Seth Rollins may have the biggest ego in the @WWE! #RAW #WWE
Seth Rollins sucks, think he should be reprimanded for what he did last Monday night!
Seth Rollins won't be happy till he loses the wwe championship to @JohnCena on Sunday #TheRoadToSummerSlam #raw
Since Seth Rollins has stolen Finn Balor's Sling Blade and His finisher, he may as well steal his entrance... #BGSummerSlam
This Sunday John Cena is going to march in that ring, fucking destroy Seth Rollins and walk out with The WWE World Heavyweight championship
This sunday you will be my bitch, Seth Rollins hahahahahaha #RAW

~Championship. Seth Rollins can run his mouth about me all he wants, but when August 23rd comes, the time for talk is over!

@WWE @Sting @WWERollins  I'm going for Seth Rollins to win. Sting may put up a good match but won't be enough.
@WWE, I'm sure you've heard that Jay Lethal wants to cross brands and wrestle Seth Rollins. That belongs on Monday's RAW and would be huge.
@WWERollins @CFBelltown Seth Rollins great match with Neville on Monday night raw very entertaining match

@mongbow Happy birthday for tomorrow! May you get the naked Seth Rollins you've always wanted ;)
@reverseleo Seth Rollins had a title match with John Cena  Seth Broke his nose And now people want title shots cause cena may not make it
A feud with John Cena may be enough to make me interested in Seth Rollins again. There has to be some irony in there.
Adrian Neville and Seth Rollins blew the roof off of that place on Monday Night Raw and Adrian Neville you did awesome!!!!!!
Alright, give me Seth Rollins, and give me the Dudle8y Boyz. C'mon, let's see them. #SmackDown
As long as Seth Rollins leaves with his title Sunday night then I'll be happy #RAW #TitleForTitle
As much as I love John Cena and respect him as a champion I want Seth Rollins to win tomorrow night!
Best way to start Monday Night Rollins is with Seth Rollins himself #TheBest
C'mon @WWE let's make it a Seth Rollins statue on a pole match at Night of Champions. #StingVsRollins
C'mon we all know Seth Rollins is going to win. #WWEchampionship #RAW
Catching up on WWE for the week thanks to the Saturday night reruns. Seth Rollins is underappreciated.
Dont miss this tomorrow: Superstars Ink on http://t.co/iHJX9nInON w/ its 1st guess, the WWE &amp; US Champ, Seth Rollins http://t.co/Su0zB8FZH8
Hey @wwe my name is Shaky Knee. I ordered the Seth Rollins U Can't C Knee shirt and I need it before Sunday. Let's make this work.
Holy crap!  watched @JohnCena 's promo when signing the contract to face Seth Rollins. WOW! "This Sunday, I'm gonna make you mine" (bitch)
I don't care what others may say, Seth Rollins is one of the best. Easily the best WWE champion in the last few years. #WWE #SummerSlam
I fucking love Seth Rollins and would be so happy if he walked away with two belts next Sunday.
I hope that John Cena wins the wwe world heavyweight champion for the 16th time &amp; Seth Rollins is right the future is now. #titlefortitle
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/ovUOjsIjG0 WWE RAW, Seth Rollins vs Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Champion, Aug 10,
I really hope the @WWE are working on a "Hall of Fame" style bust for Seth Rollins for Monday. @WWERollins #SethRollinsistheCure
I'm really hoping Seth Rollins finds a way to win on Sunday. I don't want to see Cena reign #16. No thanks.
It's $125 for the Seth Rollins meet and greet on Friday. Seth, I love you and all and your my favorite wrestler but HELL NO
Just got done watching wwe Monday night raw I'm glad Seth rollins stayed the champion Randy Orton came close of being the champion
Make a wwe world heavyweight championship match on Monday night raw with Seth Rollins vs roman reigns and you can BELIEVE THAT
My middle daughter just told me a 5th grade presentation in her class was on Seth Rollins.  #school #wwe #education
My son's braden 8th birthday got money in the bank briefcase due to Seth Rollins. Can you say happy birthday seth rollins to my son?
Now It's time for #TitleforTitle! This is Sunday Night Rollins! Seth Rollins is the cure! #FutureIsNow #SummerSlam
Oh man. Seth Rollins is going to be on @SINowlive in Friday and it's my day off :(

STING returns to WWE MONDAY NIGHT RAW!!! IT'S SHOWTIME!!! Seth Rollins that's a challenge for the WWE WORLD... http://t.co/lyHuCLPDwA
STING vs. Seth Rollins on September 20th for the World Title! Amazing! http://t.co/xoNwHr5Syx
Saturday Night Observation: I'm really surprised Seth Rollins never "had to" change his hair style after winning the World Title.
Seth Rollins absolutely has to win this Sunday if they don't want to ruin him forever now.
Seth Rollins becomes the 3rd man in history (Goldberg &amp; Booker T) to hold both World Championship &amp; United States Championship #SummerSlam
Seth Rollins def. John Cena to become #WWELinear Champion for the 4th time! Rollins ends Cena's 16th reign as champ! http://t.co/JEPgIWMYaa
Seth Rollins has always been the future and being  the guy to finally beat cena just solidified his legacy #1st #TitleforTitle
Seth Rollins has nothing to worry about. As long as he wears white and gold, he'll be fine on the 20th. #WWE #Raw #ColorsOfChampions
Seth Rollins is going to be at the house show in Beaumont. So i think he may win. I really doubt the WWE WHC will be at a house show #RAW
Seth Rollins kicks off #RAW and he may have a message for Sting.
Seth Rollins may be a 'coward' or a 'sellout' but he is definitely an awesome little ninja! #SummerSlam #TitleForTitle #CenaVsRollins
Seth Rollins may have lost, but he broke Cena!  #RAWSanJose
Seth Rollins promo has been better than the first two hours of Monday Night #RAW
Seth Rollins rolling in with a STRONG Saturday Night Fever feel.... #SummerSlam
Seth Rollins won by the help of Stewart... https://t.co/VmO2ySWaPE
Seth Rollins' 1st Superstar to hold both World+US Title, but will he be the 1st to retain both titles in the same night?? #NightOfChampions
Seth Rollins' statue will be one billion cubits in height, so that he may be remembered FOR ALL ETERNITY~!. #Raw @TNACreative
Seth rollins would have been a great champion if he does all things whatever he says every monday night on #raw in the middle of this ring
That was stupid by John Stewart but who cares Seth Rollins is now the 1st man to hold WWE title &amp; US title together #SummerSlam
This may be the fashionista in me (#ShaneIsMrX) but #ComradeOfTheDay is also bestowed upon New Day's &amp; Seth Rollins' ring gear.
Time to start Monday Night #RAW with a typical (generic) opening promo from Seth Rollins, such greatness.
Tonight Monday night was fucking great a lot of supper stars came and so did sting and he beat the hell out of Seth Rollins that's we do
Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch......... This Sunday, Imma make you mines. - @JohnCena to Seth Rollins, lmao that was a great promo.
WWE Fans glad thank you @StephMcMahon @WWEUniverse  Sting vs. Seth Rollins John Cena vs. Seth Rollins  Good Luck Sunday Sept 20!
What a amazing Monday Night Raw!! Epic ending so excited to see @Sting challenge Seth Rollins for the WWE Championship #RAW #WWE #Sting
When was the last time we've had a subpar Monday Night #Raw? Tonight looks to be no different! Seth Rollins is gold.
Why is Stone Cold on the cover of #WWE2K16? He's hardly ever on anymore. Seth Rollins would be better. This may declare a no buy for me!
YAAASSS hire him full time so he and Seth Rollins can beef forever https://t.co/30K6SHOohk
Yeah, I think I want a Seth Rollins shirt. Cuz that's what champions do. His 1st-X-Men-movie-costume pants wouldn't hurt, either. #raw
me the first day of work: ok so I need off next Sunday I have tickets to see Seth Rollins
seth rollins is going to be in daytona on sunday and i need to be there.
'There's no point to Sharknado, they may as well as had Slothnado. Sloths killing ppl with their hooks'
@Ike58Reese or just watch something more meaningful than Sharknado!! Cmon man! May i suggest @neiltyson 's #cosmos - feed your brain yo
@MattFossen @FrankConniff 1st, they did do Plan 9. 2nd, Sharknado is not earnestly bad, it's ironically so. That's why MST3K wouldn't work
@yuu_naoyuki this is the 3rd one. Check Sharknado and Sharknado 2 too. XD it's horrible that it's hilarious. This is a really bad movie.
A 60 mile flame burning hotter than the surface of the sun!?!  Come on Sharknado, that is even ridiculous for you.
All you people watching Sharknado tomorrow are they terrorists hate us.
How did Sharknado get a 3rd film? How did Sharknado even get a film to begin with? Life doesn't make much sense.
I am not in the right frame of mind to attempt to watch Sharknado 3 yet. I may need to start drinking.
I can't believe people really like Sharknado enough for them to make a 3rd part. So stupid.
I don't even understand how Sharknado is even a thing, let alone having a 3rd movie. The SE suck, the acting sucks, and it's so dumb I laugh
I dont understand the obsession with Sharknado.... watched the first two and they sucked. Im sure the 3rd one is just as bad.
I figured Sharknado was played out at #2 &amp; tonight we get #3?   I won't be watching, just like the 1st 2
I hate the Sharknado fandom. It's a poor imitation of so bad it's good. Also I  don't care if April lives #suckmynado
I sat through the whole of Sharknado 2 I'm pretty sure NS is nothing compared to that shit.
I think Sharknado 3 may have jumped the shark, and gone too far down the make a bad movie road. The second half is just awful in a bad way.
I'm convinced listening to the Freak Show tomorrow morning will be WAY better than that Sharknado ending. @fsmikey @FSBigBob
It may be significant to some of those who enjoy movies with a cult following but Sharknado is a disgrace to the film industry
It sucks we live in a world where Sharknado is about to start a 4th sequel but we can't get a Tron 3 or Dredd 2.
Just starting to watch Sharknado 4 the 1st time. Craptacular already. Cc @beerlytweeting @hadyngreen
Okay the first Sharknado was funny but do we really need a 4th movie? I think I lost a few brain cells after watching the 3rd
Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No, is that the movies title or just everyone's reaction when they heard a 3rd one was being churned out?
Sharknado 3 comes on tonight. Yes, a movie about a shark tornado has made it to a 3rd movie, and yes, I too have lost all faith in humanity.
Sharknado 3 may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.
Sharknado 3 may have overdone it just a little bit. And that's saying something for a Sharknado movie.
Sharknado is definitely the best of the worst. Come see the spectacle this Thursday at 6 &amp;9pm in the RH Theatre! http://t.co/lfOjKxaM9q
Sharknado is one of the worst movies in existence, but I'm watching it for the 10th time for some unknown reason
Sharknado is the silliest film franchise so badly produced I cudnt stop laughing through the 2nd, I saw sharks flying n had to call it a day
Sharknado may be the worst movie ever created
Sharknado may well be the flat out dumbest thing ever to occupy a TV screen.
Sharknado was funny the first time. We humored them for the 2nd. But a THIRD? Even I'm not enough of a fan of bad movies to watch that shit.
Shout out to @ZombeaversMovie for being the worst movie since @SharknadoSyfy... Sharknado has a chance to reclaim the title tomorrow...
The 1st Sharknado was good, the 2nd bad and the 3rd was just pathetic. They are making a 4th, but I'm done with them now! #sharknado
The Great Wall of Sharknado, the 9th Wonder of the World. Oh, HELL NO! #Sharknado3
The Zoo miniseries may be the worst collection of images &amp; sounds man has ever produced. We're talking Sharknado w/o the self-awareness.
The fact that there is a 3rd Sharknado is everything that is wrong with this world...   Lamer than my #LameJoke collection...   #Sharknado3
Unfollowing anyone tweeting about Sharknado, may god have mercy on yr soul
Who knew there were enough people in the world easily pleased by shite like Sharknado that they're getting a 4th instalment?!
Why does someone make the effort to produce a 3rd movie of Sharknado anyways lmao
may i just say the lighting in Sharknado 3 could use a little work?????
#AprilLives because the gorgeous @TaraReid IS the franchise player! Aliens has Ripley, Sharknado has April!! #Sharknado3
#ImNotSuperstitiousBut I have to watch Sharknado tonight and Sharknado 2 and the premiere of Sharknado 3 tomorrow. #SyFy
#Sharknado3 April Lives Can't wait for Sharknado 4 begin the Hypenado!
.@TaraReid April needs to be alive! Sharknado wouldnt be the same without her! #AprilLives
1st time watching Sharknado--too freaking funny! Luv the cast! Watching #3&amp; def will watch the 1st two! Gotta join Sharknado cult following!
2 things twitter: 1, Jack Daniels pairs very well with cherry juice and 2, Sharknado 3 may be the greatest movie ever.
22minutes until the Sharknado hits for the 3rd time. Oh Hell No!!!! #sharknado3 #Syfy #Toledo #BBN
@Adam_Squid_Ward yo dawg, friendly reminder about Sharknado tomorrow. You still up to come?
@GloriaChapa1 Sorry about the Sharknado 3 tweet. Forgot you must wait until Sat. to see it. Won't say any more but think you'll enjoy it.
@HenryJGomez People tweet a lot about Svengoolie on Saturday. It seems a lot like that with Sharknado!
@IAmJericho looking forward to watching you in Sharknado 3 tomorrow night !!
@IanZiering Thank you, Ian, for making "Sharknado" our family's new guilty pleasure!!!  Can't wait for the 4th! #AprilLives
@MadhuCheri tomorrow night is red carp[et premiere of Sharknado 3. Cindy has a great cameo in it.
@MarieDJones Think Sharknado is on Netflix. While being a veggie today I may look for it. :)
@NicolaMDavidson then you're set for a Sharknado. Tomorrow SyFy channel is showing all 3 back to back. I may need to stock up.
@SharknadoSyfy @HarveyLevinTMZ @TMZ Great movie Sharknado is the best one yet.Where is the audition for the 4th movie I want in.Great stuff.
@Simonjenkin #simonika hivemind!   We should watch sharknado tomorrow...it might just blow your mind #sorry #notsorry
@TaraReid  Never had a need for Twitter. Then Sharknado made the public responsible for April's life. Hope to see you in Sharknado 4.
@TaraReid I hope to see u in Sharknado 4! April just gave birth to a baby inside a freaking shark! she can survive everything! #AprilLives
@TaraReid I want April to Live to see SHARKNADO 4! #AprilLives
@TaraReid can't wait to see what happens to April in sharknado 4 hope she lives
@YesItsColin  Always a good time with Sharknado and Twitter. Plays again Saturday at 7
@faithantion I am now watching Sharknado for the 1st time. This will be interesting
@imasillypirate @triadvstrinity @DavidHasselhoff He's in Sharknado man, we may as well get him to swim the ball back to me! Well played Hoff
@keselowski On Hell No...great job in Sharknado. See you in Daytona in February your Body Guard from SR Perrott. Have a"Lite" Day Brad.
@planetjedward Ahhh ill be watching Sharknado tomorrow Wish I could see it now! =:D
@prettybaby69 Are you going to watch Lavalantula tomorrow night on SyFy? Looks pretty good. Has some big shoes to fill because of Sharknado.
@tenebrae2012 So @Liquid_Galaxy just told us that he watched Sharknado 3 on Friday and that they are making a FOURTH one! \o/ =))
A happy fun loving Saturday 2 the wonderful @TaraReid true CHAMPION of Sharknado films an always shows the love 2 everyone across the world
Also, Sharknado 3 tomorrow! Bring on the campy shark and theme park humor!
April has to live. Sharknado wouldn't be the same without her tiny chainsaw. #aprillives
April is the best part of sharknado! If April dies, Sharknado will jump the shark @TaraReid #AprilLives #Sharknado3 #OhHellNo #AprilLives
Bit behind the times, but Sharknado may be the best thing I've ever seen. #comedygold
Cable here is running Sharknado (the 1st one) right now! This movie is the dumbest thing I've ever LOVED...
Can it just be tomorrow so I can see @CassieScerbo in Sharknado 3 #Sharknado3 #OhHellNo
Can't wait for tomorrow . . . won't have to hear about Sharknado anymore.
Columbus friends, are any of you willing to go see the Sharknado 3 premier with me tomorrow night? Actual party downtown, not a theatre!
Cost of running the 1st advertisement in Sharknado 3 probably rivals the Super Bowl. Nice play there, @hotelsdotcom.
Dad said he can't go to party on the patio tomorrow because he needs to be home so he can watch Sharknado. Cool.
Enjoying Sharknado for the 3rd time in a row #Sharknado3
Finally getting a chance to watch Sharknado 3. I liked the 1st one a lot and loved the 2nd one, so I've really been looking forward to it.
From the makers of the Sharknado franchise comes a new movie on Saturday called Lavalantula. I must see this.
George is LIVE tweeting during the premiere of Sharknado 3 tomorrow!  Join in! http://t.co/sPRT4dIn9L
Going to get drunk and watch the badness that is Sharknado 3. This is going to be a good Sunday night.
Good Thursday morning, #Weatherhounds! Glad to see y'all survived the Sharknado outbreak more or less intact.
Hanging with my Monsters on a Saturday night watching Sharknado ! They love it ! #Sharknado3 http://t.co/ckzCiTZVlZ
Happy Sharknado 3 eve. May the plot be thin and the cameos ridiculous.
Hey @TaraReid Sharknado is all about April!! You better be in Sharknado 4 Team April all the Way! Tara U Rock! http://t.co/6uRApfph2q
Hey @billengvall:  can't wait for Sharknado 3 tomorrow night! What is the name of your character?  Woo hoo!!  @SharknadoSyfy #GaryMartinHays
Hopefully y'all is still doing the vote for April thingy on sharknado! #AprilDies
How's everyone's Saturday night? Don't lie. Ur laying in your bed with your smartphone up in the air, with Sharknado 3 in the background.
I can't wait to go to the beach then watch sharknado tomorrow
I don't care if April is dead or alive, I just can't wait for Sharknado 4
I got my sister's kids to watch Sharknado. They're asking about the 3rd one already
I have grown to love @TaraReid's character, April, throughout the Sharknado franchise. #Sharknado3
I have watched every Sharknado and have made plans to watch the 3rd one. Let's goooo
I hope I can catch Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No tomorrow night idc how bad it is
I just found out Sharknado 3 comes out tomorrow night. I'm beyond excited
I like Sharknado but I don't like the April character
I like that there's no messing around in Sharknado, just action. You don't even have to wait 10 mins for the 1st sharky sequence! #OhHellNo
I may get killed for this but I watched 15 minutes of pretty little liars. The girls acting ability is as good as the acting in Sharknado.
I may or may not have just DVR'd the Sharknado trilogy for Saturday. Can't wait to see what the hype is about. #sorrynotsorry
I see Jimmy made it into sharknado, so wnci should be hilarious tomorrow.
I want them to amp all the way up to an 11th Sharknado, then do 12th where two guys in shark costumes just reenact "My Dinner With Andre."
I want to see Sharknado 3.  Someone record it onto a DVD tomorrow and bring it to the track Thursday.
I watched Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! today and it was really really awesome! Better than 2nd, better or on par with 1st. The Hoff on the moon!
Id rather watch sharknado on repeat all day than have to get up at 5 tomorrow (:
If I don't go to the gym tomorrow night, I can watch SHARKNADO 2 again. It has been too long since I watched.
If you're not planning to watch Sharknado 3 tomorrow then idk what you're doing with your life tbh
Is it weird I'm excited for Sharknado 3 tomorrow night?
It's the Saturday of a long weekend and I'm at home watching Sharknado. This is my new life.
It's time for Sharknado 3. We know how to live it up on Saturday night.
JUST WATCHED SHARKNADO 3 AND HOLY SHIT THE END WITH APRIL, the giving birth in a shark is new to me.. #aprillives #sharknado3 @SharknadoSyfy
Jake and I will be in Sharknado 4. We may die in the first scene, but we'll be in it. #HollywoodDreams
Just watched Sharknado 3 can't wait for the 4th
LRT: I'm planning to watch Sharknado 3 tomorrow, but I just wanted to point out...um. NASA is tweeting about Sharknado.
Looking forward to Sharknado 3 tomorrow. Tara cant act her way out of a paper bag and her face can no longer show ANY emotion. I LOVE it!
Loved the Today Show peeps on 3rd installment of "Sharknado"!! @TODAYshow   @SharknadoFans
Make sure to watch Sharknado 3 Hell No tomorrow! @maryse0uellet is in the movie! but you'll have to find her ;)
May I be excused? "To do what?" "So I can watch Sharknado?" "... Thank you for being honest." My 11-year-old sister is cooler than me.
My brother's reaction to the end of Sharknado may be the single greatest thing i have ever witnessed. #epic
My kids look forward to the Sharknado movies, because they are awesomely horrible....and we need April! #AprilLives
My mom is really lecturing me about how Sharknado is such a good movie &amp; that everyone watches it which is why they came out with a 3rd one.
My plans were to Sharknado 1&amp;2 it up for tomorrow's big premiere... But OITNB won. 1/2way thru season 3.. I need more hrs in the day..
Oh my god, Sharknado in space! This is even cooler the 2nd time! #Sharknado3
Oh you know, just making sure my schedule tomorrow allows me to watch SHARKNADO 3
Ok. Tonight "Sharknado 3", the 25th "Lavantula", oh you are so lucky US friends!
Our 7th and 8th graders had a blast at the "Sharknado" Back-to-School dance last night!!
Really has to start watching the Sharknado movies now. They'e already on 3 and announcing a 4th movie, and I have yet to see even 1 /o\
Really, this Sharknado cast may be the. Best since Boogie Nights.
SHARKNADO 3 tomorrow!??? Best day of my life
SHARKNADO TONIGHT!!! OHMYGOD I AM SO EXCITED even though I can't watch it til Saturday...
Sharknado 3 comes out tomorrow and I think I'm going to cry with happiness
Sharknado 3 may be the best film I've seen yet. #Sharknado3 #America
Sharknado 3 may have been the best one
Sharknado 3 may have just slid its way into my top 5 movies
Sharknado 3 release and @andrew_esqueda 's 29th birthday on the same day. Coincidence...? HBD Andrew!!! https://t.co/U4fo41KsGc
Sharknado 3 tomorrow if your not excited you ain't living right
Sharknado 3 tomorrow. Sorta like the best day ever.
Sharknado 4. Doesn't really matter what people thought of the 3rd. People might as well get ready for a 5th.
Sharknado is the best movie ever, but April has got to go. #AprilDies
Sharknado triple feature tonight...Lavalantula with Police Academy star on Saturday!!!  Scyfy channel is on fire!
Sharknado's on!!! Then the 2nd one! Then #ohhellno #3 at 9. Shoulda left work early.
Sharknado, ftw! C'mon, how could this not be the first thing listed? #Sharkmovies @midnight
Sharknado3 tomorrow night! The original Sharknado is on tonight at 9:00 in case you've been living under a rock. Only on Syfy #BestMovieEver
So I notice on SyFy website you can vote if April lives or dies in Sharknado 4. Essentially they announced Shaknado 4... What a great day!
So... Uh guys. Sharknado is tomorrow. Would anyone wanna celebrate it with me on WadaTwitter
Sorry I can't make it in to work tomorrow got caught in a SHARKNADO
Stop what you're doing. Sharknado is on syfy channel. And Sharknado 3 premieres tomorrow night. Life is good
Think I may have fallen in love with @CassieScerbo only 30 minutes into Sharknado 1 ha.
This VMA drama is just trying to distract us from Sharknado 3 tomorrow
This may be pathetic but I'm soo excited for Sharknado 3. Best to watch with lil kids tho.
This may be the best Sharknado of all Sharknado's ! Loving #Sharknado3
Tricking my mom into watching Sharknado and Sharknado 2: The Second One before the party tomorrow night #Sharknado3
Wanna watch Sharknado 3 but I've yet to see Sharknado 1 or 2! So I'll watch those 2 before I watch the 3rd movie!
Wasn't gonna watch Sharknado tonight but I may have to catch a peak to see @keselowski @joeylogano and the @NASCAR crew
Watched Sharknado tonight with mom while she recovered from surgery. Now she wants to watch 2 and 3 tomorrow. I love my mom.
Watching Sharknado is the only call with #Sharknado3 coming tomorrow
Watching Sharknado waiting for the 3rd one at 9
Watching Sharknado with Kaden. This is the 2nd one I guess... surprising.
Watching the original Sharknado prepping for #Sharknado3 tomorrow.
We are 5 minutes in on Sharknado 3 #OhHellNo and already I think this may be the most impactful movie since Schindler's List
What Ebert said about the FRIDAY THE 13th series is actually true of SHARKNADO: whatever you say about one can stand for all of them.
Who else is going to be singing the Sharknado soundtrack at work tomorrow? #Sharknado3
Why am I watching Sharknado 3 for the 3rd time this weekend?
Yes, Sharknado 4 Is Happening: Sharknado 3 had barely premiered Wednesday night before the studio annou... http://t.co/cOFUH1T4Gv (Time)
You'd think with as successful a franchise as Sharknado they could splurge a little on the crappy cgi for this 3rd installment.
answered all requests but signing off for the night it is time for Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No! see you all tomorrow
but today is one direction's 5th anniversary  sharknado 3 is coming and cory tweeted about sharknado and makes me wanna cry im so emotional

i am so excited to watch sharknado after work tomorrow no one even gets it
such a good ending to SHARKNADO 3!  YOU DECIDE BY TWITTER HASHTAG IF APRIL LIVES OR DIES!  the answer will be... http://t.co/9xIQwd7afq
@GenieBowl Like Tyler and Luke's teams with Josh and Devin close behind. Hate Shawn's team. If I had to choose a 2nd worst team it's Dustin.
@jdilley_3 Harvey and Shawn have put me on the no access list along with Bo and Carl Pelini. Otherwise I'd be there tomorrow.

the only time I haven't put on foundation is when I met Shawn for the 3rd time it was great
the other day in class I told this girl I like shawn and she says "he's not that hot." 1st, yes he is. 2nd, even if he wasn't I don't care.
tomorrow will mark a year since i saw shawn live for the first time
v sad bc a bunch of people are meeting Shawn in San Diego and I'm laying in my couch watching the day after tomorrow in Spanish
wait for the island show tomorrow is Shawn gonna be doing his full set or just some songs

wearing the hottest top I have ever owned on Wednesday to see The Vamps genuinely more excited for the outfit than the concert
@El_Kurry maybe tomorrow there will be a new superhero on the streets. Either that Thor is really angry
@LokiSilberzunge "Yes,I did.It was a disaster.I saw Thor on the news.I was very concerned." Tom sat next to him,placing his hand on his~
@Polygon no less ridiculous than ANY of the THOR movies by Marvel. Or Melinda May beating up any guy on Agents of SHIELD
@TomLovesLoki *I sat in my cell after my little chat with Odin. I was to sit and rot while Thor ruled Asgard. How disgusted I felt. I heard~
@YZYMANDIAS It's everyone. Like, eventually; the sun will burn up even in Marvel land. I guess Thor might get out okay but who cares.
@chancetherapper will be performing this Saturday on #SNL and he just did a promo with fuckin' Thor:  https://t.co/f5Jj1Wc7LM
@dubs_mike80 If Escobar was hurt I would hope you would be calling for Thor's suspension. If KC throws up tomorrow, you should have no prob
@theism_sucks @Athletes4Him Thor: What a pussy. Other God's have universes, Thor gets a measly day of the week "Thursday" #meh
From here on out I will no longer celebrate the pagan holiday of Thursday (Thor's Day)
I celebrate Christmas, @PrincessJules98, and I don't believe in Christ. Just like I call it Thursday but don't believe in Thor.
I don't understand the narrative that Thor owned the game because of that first pitch. The Royals got to him in the 1st &amp;  2nd, right?
I now feel bad for buying a Thor novel for $4.95 at Barnes &amp; Noble, but now I know why it was $4.95. #LCD  https://t.co/p2HKOUAgLp
It's a Sunday afternoon in the small, church-going town of Covington. I look like trash and Thor's hungover. Cue the judgemental stares.
Migraine from the loud blackness going on Thor early Monday morning wish people would stfu being loud for no reason
Oh actually this will be Thor's 10th skin. Still don't like it and the hair bothers me.
Someone should have told Thor that sun in is just for hair and not for eyebrows
Thor's powers are so inconsistent in MCU. In the first movie he took out the Destroyer in one hit. 2nd one he's struggling with a dark elf.
Well now all the pre-teen aged girls who were thinking of paying money to go watch Thor or Kong at the movies are going to have 2nd thoughts
#JessicaJones brilliant show, just watched 1st episode, can't believe its still the same universe as Thor, Guardians Of The Galaxy &amp; IronMan

@Autumnjoiee ion know cause I feel like Thor would too but then again Thor is really humble so you may be right
@CheesusSlice @PrinceHAK33M yeah, well I had Thor's hammer and helmet in the 5th grade. And Storm's cape. I still haven't grown up. LOL

@InMetsWeTrust 5th Ace? Sure, Why Not? BALDER is the brother of Thor in Norse Mythology. Seems a reasonable moniker for a red hot baller.
@IrvMagic13 @Buster_ESPN Thor will have sack up in April when he watches the Royals raise the WS banner on opening day.  Want tickets?
@JennMatthews57 Feel so much better knowing Thor will be in the house Sunday. https://t.co/RGsHzCbMgz
@JustAnIronMan It's not just a helmet to me. [He sighs, muttering under his breath before answering him.] As for Thor, he's back tomorrow.
@KevinKimmich Tin, one of the 7 metals known to the ancients was associated with Jupiter/Zeus. Thursday = Thor's day (jueves) is the Tin Day
@LoyalLadySif it's queen. Nevertheless,Thor shook those feelings off as he and Sif approached their table and sat down
@MochineGun I think Thor is B-list like Kriss said b/c he's probably one of the 1st names you know if you read comics, but otherwise no idea
@Noahsyndergaard  great game &amp; way to make a statement on the 1st pitch.  Very Bob Gibson of u. Beware of Thor the hammer will come! #LGM
@Noahsyndergaard He told me to tell you "Thor may have the hammer, but I hit bombs - bring it" - the kid is crazy.. https://t.co/HxPhk2y56d
@OfIceAndBlood Owen grinned, this may be a little easier. "I've heard a lot about you from Thor and Chris. It's lovely to meet you!"

@WpgHockTalk true, but I thought the 5 on 5 play was pretty even though well into the 3rd. You didn't? That Mighty Thor goal huge.
@cynsykes and I just watched Thor for like the 20th time last night
@gabbyyarce your "point" is invalid Thursday is named after Thor, therefore you're doing it wrong@VeggieNinja23 @Lil_Cheatham @the_campos12
@garwboy of course, you can always use the fact that today, Thursday, Thor's day, celebrates another religion, thus apostasy.
@littlebaldie_ Thursday is Thor's day, if you wanna get picky about it you're gonna need to rename the days of the week too
@macrocredit @Reagoikanya turns into Cupid in February, becomes the Easter Bunny and does short stints as Superman, Thor &amp; other characters
@msimonespn @greg_prince @jasoncfry love that camera close up of Thor. Can't wait for the first pitch tomorrow night
@nayrelyk7 @Starbucks Funny how you call it "Thursday" and don't believe Thor was real.
@oedo30 Oh is he teaming up with Thor in the 3rd Thor movie? Awesome, can't wait to see how that will work. All these movies are so good.

I got really excited for the cosplay cover of Thor tomorrow and then I remembered that Kevin is on issue 2 :/
I knew Thor would get the job done. Matz on tomorrow, offense seems to be waking up, Let's Go Mets!!! #LGM
I knew that Escobar attacks 1st pitches, so there you go, hit this one.. Thor is a real life hero. #LGM
I like Thorburn with Copp and Halischuk on the 4th line.  Really like Thor on the 4th line.
I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
I love that Thor's cover was inspired by Madvillainy's cover that was inspired by the cover for Madonna's 1st LP. https://t.co/cwsS6zz09Q
I really want what Thor had in that flask in the 2nd Avengers. #Drank

I want to dress up as Thor tomorrow and wear a Syndergaard jersey.
I watched the big bang theory on Thursday when I was at home but I cannot get Footprints on the moon's Thor &amp; Dr Jones out my head!
I'd say for my Top 5 it's Nu Wa, Ravana, Thor, Sun Wukong and Serqet
I'm loving all these quotes from the cry baby Royals about Thor's 1st pitch to Escobar. If I'm Matz, I'm doing the same thing Saturday.
I've only had 3 costumes come in tonight, and they were all Marvel.  Thor, Thor, and Wolverine. https://t.co/3zlDihe8ml
It has to be Thor for me @marvel love the character, and Chris Hemsworth plays him well. I feel Civalwar may change this tho! #Marvel2015

Jason Aaron certainly has a thing for nihilistic annihilators...1st Thor's Gorr the God Butcher &amp; now Dr Strange's magic killing Empirikul.

People who know baseball know Thor is the player of the game cause after the 2nd inning he started dealing and kept mets alive
Pretty sure of the 1st like 25 Marvel characters, 2 had capes. Dr. Strange and Thor. And by the way a cape totally works on Dr. Strange.
Put it in the books! Big games for The Captain, Thor, and Granderson. Let's got Matz tomorrow! #LGM
Regardless of what happens- Thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future #LGM #Mets

Skye: Wouldn't mind getting my human hands on Thor. He's so dreamy. Coulson: Sure, he's handsome, but - May: [interrupting] No. He's dreamy.
So I checked this out on the Google, today is... 'Thor's Day!' How much better is that than Thursday?

@TerryGilliam Sat my daughter down and we watched 12 Monkeys. Changed her mind about what a really good movie is (NOT Twilight)
@maricruzannette first time I heard of "twilight" I assumed it was a horror/thriller flick, but I sat thru it. Imagine my disappointment..
@twats0n what are you some stupid Twilight vampire? REAL ones don't go outside to tan. They sleep in complete darkness until the sun is down
Did the sun even be bother to get up today? Desperate for a holiday tho, even if it is in a frozen twilight ._.
Finally watching Twilight for the 1st time. Now I can see why I avoided it #socringeworthy #awkwardacting :S

twilight Good morning and happy Friday, all! Anyone else braving the crowds for twilight tonight?
@SaintFrankly I may not be speaking for the whole world here, but have always thought Bono is a wanker &amp; U2 overrated. There I have said it.
@U2_ultraviolet naww U2 may not be the best band for you then
@jamesjrobertson U2, at this point, may be the worst U2 tribute band.
I'm pretty sure U2 invented the 3rd world so they had someone who actually looked them.
Or maybe Apple will bring U2 back. We're kidding. U2 is totally not going to come back  Haha  https://t.co/qkyqVgrnkd
Sunday Candy is a better song than U2 or Temper Trap have ever written. And it's a rapper and his live band, so,
That U2 album that they sneaked unto my Itunes is still there. I swear I deleted it. Lord knows Bono may be the anti-Christ.
Today I sat down and make a conscious effort to try to actually like a U2 song. Unsuccessful.
#Bono hand delivered pizza to fans waiting in GA line for the U2 concert tomorrow. This band is the definition of awesome. #U2 #U2ieTour
#KCA #VoteJKT48ID 5SOSListenedTo: Calum listened to (and tweeted about) Sunday Bloody Sunday (Live) by U2!

It's that kind of a night that you need to listen to U2 while thinking of everything that you need to accomplish tomorrow.
Jealous of all the people going to see U2 in October :(
Just makes you smile when you walk out side, the sun is shining and U2's It's a Beautiful Day is playing in the background.

On a Monday when I'm waiting for things that are stressing me, 1st song on the radio? I Still Haven't What I'm Looking For by U2. Thanks ar.
Radio just played U2's "Bad". Which rarely happens &amp; is one of my very favorite songs of all time so my day may have just peaked very early.
Sat what you want about U2, slag them off if you will, but I still think they were a damn fine class of submarine
Some band nearby playing U2's Sunday Bloody Sunday. That's better than the terrible music my neighbors usually play
Sunday Bloody Sunday - U2 - Get Wholesome, Before the Shit Hits the Fan. http://t.co/gplMv0n8Vu #music  #wholesome
Sunday frustrated Sunday! Sung in the manner of U2. Hello Hello! #U2 #yeahyeahyeah
THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE by U2 was no.12 in the UK album charts on 31 August 1985

I don't blame Lee, though. If I understand it correctly, Watchman is basically the messy 1st draft to the masterpiece that is Mockingbird.
I may never read "Watchman" after this review. What would be the point? https://t.co/C6G1DUO5RY
So Watchman is an earlier draft of Mockingbird?? People have been had in getting excited for this. C'mon public, you're better than this.
To all the people who will buy Go Set a Watchman tomorrow:  go buy/read To Kill a Mockingbird instead
Worth reading. Another troubling argument for why the publication of "Watchman" may have been an act of elder abuse. https://t.co/QU0D4j3NIh
#demthrones @TBGWT Jon Snow was spotted Tues in Belfast with another popular Night Watchman,  where GOT is currently filming...just sayin!
@Ceilidhann @BeckiHawkes however conflicted I may feel about Watchman's publication this is a hella great upside to it.
@LoweCatherine I can't wait to get Watchman tomorrow...more because I want to see her maturation as a writer. Forensic reading.
@breeahnuh_ yes, it's true I've missed all my children but no Go Set a Watchman gets released Tuesday

@motowncatscrown - Yep. Believe the Indians are in the 10th slot (lost today) and the White Sox are 11th (losing). Tigers 12th.
@sbass1310 unfortunately, the White Sox haven't helped much this week. Hoping Samardzija can help tomorrow afternoon.
Carlos Rodon (@CarlosRodon16) is on pace for his 5th straight Quality Start (6 IP, 1 ER, 4ks), but the White Sox are currently down 0-1
I hate the White Sox with the white-hot heat of 1000 suns.  Do better tomorrow, Royals.
I mean, the Tigers may be having a horrifying season but at least they don't have to wear those White Sox throwback uniforms
I'm not kidding, the White Sox are running a promotion called "Selfie Sunday". And they wonder why they're the 2nd team in the 2nd city
It's September 1st and this is what the White Sox are. It's sad to think about.
Okay so the White Sox suck, Rose and Kane may be sexual predators, and Cobb and Nelson are hurt before game one. Sports suck.
The White Sox really are in no-man's land.   4.5 games back in the 2nd Wild Card 1.5 games from a protected 1st rd pick
These White Sox untucked unis may be the most atrocious uniform I've ever seen
Tom Wilhelmsen locked down his fifth save of the season with a perfect ninth inning in Friday's 2-0 win over the White Sox. #Mariners #MLB
White Sox are lowest scoring team in the American League https://t.co/sErqGihjuW
[http://t.co/2iAIexuu4u]  White Sox on wrong page, no matter the chapter  (Sat, 29 Aug 2015 00:30:45 EST) http://t.co/1PbItB7pRY
watching the Mariners &amp; White Sox...these White Sox uniforms may be the ugliest ever
#Twins Tweets: White Sox take a 6-4 lead in the 7th. #MNTwins #MLB http://t.co/qmmUw5X82Q
@ItsReallyRach I'm going to the White Sox game on Labor Day. 110pm start. Free tshirt Monday!!!
@bmr378 Hell yeah. I'm ready for Sunday to get here. Going to the White Sox game. It's been a while!!!
@dirrty862 Nothing wrong with that. Busy day tomorrow with White Sox baseball and the heat!!
Alexei Ramirez's 3-run homer gives the White Sox a 3-0 lead over the Royals in the 4th inning.
And that's 3 runs on 1 hit here in the 10th for the White Sox...... #Mariners
BOOOM! WINNER! White Sox vs. Royals Over 8.5 10 Units  Buy 3 day package, get Labor Day Monday FREE!  SAVE $50! https://t.co/8Ziv6SD82d
Big inning for the White Sox. That error by Alexei Ramirez that allowed a run to score in the top of 8th weighing heavily right now.
Chris Sale will take a no hitter into the 7th today and the White Sox will win a wild card. You heard it here first
Diggin the Blue Jays' Canada jerseys. Would be cool if they wore them every Sunday home game like the White Sox do with their retros.
Dodgers are 4th in fewest days between no-hitters with 9 days. The White Sox lead with 1.
Garcia hit sacrifice fly to left, Eaton scored, Abreu tagged out at second. White Sox lead the Mariners 4-0 in the bottom of the 5th
If the White Sox can push one more run across the plate before CLE scores, it'll be 4th consecutive game they've jumped out to a 3-0 lead.
John Danks retires the Royals lineup in order in the 3rd, 4th and 5th innings. White Sox still leading 6-0, top of 6.
Kris Bryant with another walk off home run in the 9th, even as a White Sox fan this is fun too watch..
Looks like I'm going to another White Sox game Wednesday night! @whitesox
Miguel Sano hit his 15th homer Wednesday off the White Sox's Carlos Rodon. #Twins
The Twins are practically giving away tickets for the game on September 1st vs the White Sox.  $6 for skyline view seats!
The White Sox say Mike Olt is expected to join the team "in the coming days." Sox back here against the Indians on Monday.
The White Sox swept the Royals aka the 2nd best team in the MLB
Thinking about going to the White Sox on the 25th to cheer for the #RedSox #redsox :-) http://t.co/Ci6A3NkZk9
This is fun. We should play the White Sox more often. https://t.co/XeIA23mY8q

Tonight's Final: 4-2!!!!  White Sox win their 60th of the season. Rodon wins his 6th! http://t.co/o28xqw4Osn
Trayce Thompson continued tearing the cover off the ball Tuesday, going 3-for-4 with three RBI as the White Sox edged the Red Sox 5-4.
Welp. White Sox dominating the #Royals. May be time to go back to the full strength lineup tomorrow.
White Sox 6-4 over Twins??!!  They came from behind in the 7th
White Sox cut the #Mariners lead to 5-2 in the 6th and that's it for Kuma.  Final line: 5.2 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 4 BB &amp; 6 K. http://t.co/PxZj2agulH
White Sox get 3 hits, make 2 outs on bases that inning. Manage a run on Sanchez 2-out single to center. Soto in rundown to end 2nd. 1-0
White Sox lead the Mariners 4-0 at the end of the 6th. Pitching: SEA R Elias, CHW C Rodon (ESPN) http://t.co/YSufEjQe2q
White Sox take a 2-1 lead in the 2nd on a 2-run triple by Maiker Feliz. #AZLPlayoffs
White Sox take game one of the series in their throwback uniforms 4-2. Blog to come tomorrow! #GoMariners
White Sox take the lead on CSN! https://t.co/zSF8WFkCgm
White Sox vs Red Sox tomorrow, Cubs vs Reds on the 1st, n Bears vs Packers on the 13th. What a good going away present!
White Sox win a challenge, Alexei Ramirez ruled safe at second upon review. Sanchez up with 0 out in the 5th.
With that sweep of the Royals.White Sox  are now 3 games closer to 1st place!#WhiteSox #MLB
You can put it in the board!! Hell yes! White Sox lead 1-0 on Abreu's 24th of the season!! http://t.co/2bSpGjZGVW
Zach Duke gives up a solo homer to Jose Ramirez in the 9th. White Sox lead now at 7-4.
#YakubDebate   Gurdaspur terror attack is likely turn the public opinion against Yakub who may not get any relief from any quarter now.
#YakubToHang Matter of fate; Yakub to be hanged tomorrow on his b'day. Apart 4rm all v sud nt forget dat he is being paid off 4 his sins.
#YakubVerdict Yakub should be hang by tomorrow any how.Then it will be great victory of our Hindustan Constitutionthe half part we have won.
#YakubVerdict: my 11yr old exclaimed, tomorrow will be the worst birthday for Yakub but his 1st bday was worst for the country! Makes sense
.@bwoyblunder @India_Policy Sunday column  Praveen Swami: Yakub was just a small time smuggler
@5Forty3 the way MSM and leftists are crying for Yakub, ppl may mistake him as some son-of-soil patriot sacrificing himself for nation
@AsimBajwaISPR ur terrorist is going to be hanged tomorrow Yakub. stop sending terrorist u failed nation!!
@Atheist_Club look I can understand the argument for abolishing death penalty. You may have a point. But remorse for Yakub? Give me a break
@BeingSalmanKhan @brownbrumby Tiger is in the terrorist haven under the protective arm of Pak! So u may tweet "Hang him!"!Is Yakub innocent?
@BeingSalmanKhan By religion you are Muslim and that is why you may have pain for Yakub but he was involved in the killing of 257 people..
@BeingSalmanKhan r you drunk?how is yakub innocent?1st time dissapointed by you
@NaseerudinShah u supported Yakub.  Have guts to Show solidarity with #GurdaspurAttack victims ?  Remember cockroach from Wednesday?
@PritishNandy Yakub arranged funds for the blast,dats an equal crime. Ppl who loose their luvd ones knw d pain nd who dnt may god giv dem 1.
@RajivMessage Was this media mafia behind the fact that Yakub got front page coverage when Lt respected Kalam was on 3rd or even 5th page
@SappyReDevil Yakub has to be hanged and he will definitely be hanged at 7 am tomorrow morning. Birthday = death day.
@ShekharGupta Media did sympathize with Yakub n help in producing many young Yakubs in India. But you guys claim u r 4th pillar.bloody shame
@TimesNow It is good news for Times Now as the terrorist may be glorified like Yakub.
@TimesOfIndia btw how much money you charged from "eminent people" to make Yakub's headline a prominent one ??? https://t.co/z586zvUrsA
@UnSubtleDesi @digvijaya_28  If Congree rule at this time, Yakub may be on street with the help of 40 Ami Chando.
@_sabanaqvi btw yakub was a good terrorist !! may he never rest in peace ..
@abpnewstv why ABP is telecasting Yakub family interview.  It is to get the sympathy.  ABP may be hanged along with YAKUB
@arunvipra @mediacrooks @_sabanaqvi is wrong: Dr APJ the ex-President passed on July 27; Yakub the terrorist was hanged till death on Jul 30
@asadowaisi Go &amp; try your best to save him but we will make sure that bloody Yakub will be dead by July 30th !!!
@brownbrumby Agree with 2nd part,but Yakub is no reason. Best logical argument against his hanging by @Raghav_Bahl. @YRDeshmukh @asadowaisi
@dna Yakub's guilt has been proved &amp; pardon plea rejected. Why should a sane man spk it now. Excusing pseudo-innocent may encourage criminal
@ibnkhabar  this people who try  to save "YAKUB"  may be with DAUD  n   CHUHA TIGER"...GADDAR GANG"
@kavita_krishnan @sagarikaghose tomorrow morning u will get reply, yakub will be hanged. India is not going to be govern by presstitutes,
@kkalpu  Oh.14 days is there?   Thanks for the information. Any way this is the 2nd mercy petition. This has no value.  Yakub has to hang
@mihirssharma Hey fucker! Cry as much u want.Ur "bother" Yakub is going to be hang tomorrow.Suck it bitch.
@narendramodi Citizens are confused on Yakub undoubtedly he is a traitor and 2nd is he is traitor turned informer .... let RAW win.
@ndtv Y don't u ask ur reporters to collect pottys of Yakub menon so tomorrow you can sell it as Secular fertiliser..rubbish reporting shame
@tajinderbagga No issues if he is saving an innocent of any religion, but Yakub killed hundreds of innocent, tomo Bhushan may back ISIS too!
@tathagata2 you are right,  Yakub's mourners may be the supporters of terrorism,  they should be under scaner.
@tehseenp I just can't believe ppl like you exist, why don't u and Yakub just elope to Pakistan.https://t.co/9V4LKjh2Wb
@the_hindu May be but now it seems inevitable. Looks like pay back time  for Yakub!
@timesofindia  it was deplorable to say the least of you to dedicate almost 3 pages to Yakub &amp; ironically Mr. Kalam on 5th page. SAD day
Actually today was Yakub's birthday. I wish him many many returns of this day. May he hang in hell too.!!
All those who petitioned for stopping Yakub's hanging , may hang themselves ...This would be the best  "Shraddhanjali" to him
And like all those left behind by the 257 people he helped kill, hope Yakub's daughter finds peace &amp; a better world. She turns 21 tomorrow.
Bajrangi Bhai jan I do agree with you brother should not be hanged for brother.  But Mr. Yakub is also accused...... https://t.co/vXYiDJSBaU
But it's nothing that 257 families lost their family members because of Yakub.  https://t.co/U8A37eWphV
Conviction of Yakub by highest courts is being 2nd guessed by the likes of @sagarikaghose with zero knowledge of law. Contempt of court?
Daring Jrn'sm yes @arunjaitley fumbled @sardesairajdeep is not with Yakub or agst Babu/may but for all mass killers  https://t.co/eYzXZ0pX54
Death threat to Justice Dipak Misra who refused Yakub's mercy petition"irrespective of the protection you may avail, we will eliminate you."
Final decision about death should be made after the arrest of tiger memon..may be tiger forced to yakub for doing that...
Happy to see cogent views from most of the section of society. Yakub was a terrorist. Capital punishment may be a... http://t.co/G1SenGgr9S
Hats off to Dupreme Court who sat till early morning n did not allow attempt to postpone the hanging of Yakub.
Highly disappointed with @timesofindia : Yakub's last rites on 1st page news whereas Dr.Kalam who was laid to rest at ramehswaram on page 13
I guess, SP or Congress ruled States may create TERRORISTS WELFARE MINISTRY soon. Yakub's wife will be the 1st minister
I may sound cruel, be it, it's nice to have terrorists like Yakub languishing in prison, dying bit by bit, before actually being hanged...
I think aftr seeing all this #YakubToHang drama, the security guy at d jail would like to shoot Yakub dead rather than hanging him tomorrow
I want to hear yakub dead, when I wake up tomorrow #HangYakub
I wish Mani Shankar Aiyar commit suicide tonight to meet Yakub tomorrow in hell
If Indian agencies just lookout for who were in contact with these people trying to save Yakub, they may end up finding all conspirators !
If Yakub is not dead by this time tomorrow- let the judges who delayed it pay for his upkeep.My tax money is not meant to for terrorists
If v leave Yakub today, tomorrow again he ll kill 257 innocent people. What kind of justice,is it?#YakubDebate
It has become a wrong trend to protect the person who has been punished by SC &amp; President,without any 2nd thought Yakub be hanged#YakubDebat
Kurian Joseph, who raised stupid doubts about modi's good friday meet, now questions about yakub's death penalty.Some ppl never learn
LOL Too clever by half! Your daddy was disappointed over Yakub's hanging &amp; he was a dreaded terrorist! Get it?  https://t.co/9hMx66BwmJ
Lakh of cases R pending in supreme court even than Yakub's case being heard 6/7th time today as if there no work in court.public want answer
Leftist communists want it rewritten to show Yakub as an innocent saviour unlike what was originally written!   https://t.co/upxML7XfCg
Liberals supporting Yakub today are the same guys who will support ISIS tomorrow..
May I know @ArvindKejriwal, Do you have any proof that Yakub is Innocent? #AAPWithTerrorists
No media Hallah no Julush for  late sepoy Rachpal Singh. Or it may be he is not terorist like Yakub ."narendramodi http://t.co/J1EKydKPYf
One may argue if hanging Yakub was right or wrong. But the people who are trying to portray him as a communal hero are purely anti-national
People seeking mercy for Yakub, Hope this Punjab terror attack may jolt you out of stupidity into reality #Gurdaspur
Persons who are favoring Yakub Menen, may be HAPPY on Gurdaspur Attack. Those persons should also be hanged till death along with Yakub.
Pranab Mukherjee has just again rejected Yakub's 2nd mercy petition, hanging would be on as per schedule at 7am tomorrow #HangYakubNow .
Salman you may be a celebrity but that doesn't mean you have the licence to say Yakub is innocent.Just stick to acting.
Salman's views in favour of Yakub can be usedby prosecution in hit n run case tp prove him not a law abiding citizen,it may cost him dearly
So Yakub's wife was lying when she said we know nothing about Tiger Memon.  http://t.co/gfz3Ykfqtg
Spare me the nuances, Yakub is certainly not innocent. Rarest of the rare case? May be! #YakubToHang
Still not clear whether Yakub will be hanged Thursday! One more challenge to his death sentence in the SC
Stupid view completely one sided. Do you think we enjoyed media bias on Yakub death sentence?  https://t.co/EPAxKxoUaQ
The Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon hanged.  Seculars may sign a petition to declare Yakub as a "good terrorist" as he died on his b'day.
The march of ISIS seems to have begun in India with Yakub's funeral. They want to wave off murder of 257 on mere repentance?
Tiger Memon rang up family on July 30 before Yakub's hanging: Instead of grieving for his brother who was about to die, Tiger was  ta...
Tomorrow they will discuss #YakubHanged after their Friday prayer. Bad part is 100s of youth will get inspired to be the next Yakub.
Very bad idea 2 allow the dead body of Yakub to come to Mumbai-situation may become evn more tense @Dev_Fadnavis @HMOIndia @BJPRajnathSingh
Well Jokes apart, today or tomorrow Yakub has to meet with with 72 Hoors. S
Why Yakub is so scared of death, when he is sure of getting 72 virgins tomorrow? Why Siculars are denying Allah's guaranteed reward? Sad.
Worse ! Yakub was the polished thinktank CEO, Tiger was the roughneck shop-floor-Foreman of this evil-enterprise !  https://t.co/o3Bd4HrluE

Yakub financed the blasts and died but his brother did not care enough for him.  Tiger did not come and surrender  t http://t.co/yEH9cZFBGi
Yakub has gone. whatever happened may be right. I want asked Kiran bedi .that whatever Yakub done.it was wrong  but after Babri masjid --
Yakub is hanged.Y d cry!!Y d nonsense over his religion.Whtevr religion he may belong 2,he ws a terrorist n thts all 1 needs 2 c n undrstnd
Yakub may have been an Indian citizen, but for as a terrorist, he was as much a Pakistani as was Kasab and the terrorist caught today
Yakub may or may not hav deseved death but he definitely deservd life imprisonment 4his deeds.Shame on those who are painting him as a saint
Yakub meets destiny chosen by himself. For the killers waiting may be longer the destination will be the same!!!!
Yakub should be hanged to death tomorrow the Mumbai's culprid else will oppose it by following a black day
Yakub to be hanged at 7am tomorrow. Yakub's birthday will be his death day
Yakub will be hanged on July 30 anyway! So Why tweet in his support now? Nothing to do with his movie running in theatres. Eh, Bhaijaan?
Yakub will be hanged tomorrow. The law has finally taken its own course of time and the time period. 23 years .
Yakub's Mercy plea has been rejected.  May you be served justice in here after.  #YakubMemon
Yakub's hanging may have created a fear in the minds of the terrorists, but it hasn't created any difference in our country
You may oppose death penalty...you may demand justice for riot victims but none of this makes Yakub an innocent bystander.Stop this nonsense
all the jerks who signed petitions for mercy for Yakub have ensured he doesnt go out for them .. No?  https://t.co/oG3ZSdMwGW
having Yakub's news on the 1st page by all leading news papers is saddest thing! Shame on you @timesofindia @mataonline  #StopBuyingThem
if Yakub had faith in Indian Judicial System that he came back, why did he blow up people in Mar-93 as justice for riot victims?
if you are confident Yakub was innocent  why you not push tiger before 30 july ? http://t.co/fpSKB3Bsjc
one may argue yakub has gone thro process. hanging on his birthday is bigger message and scar to paki lovers. dangerous game has just begun
#PetitionPolitics The blasts may've been planned by Tiger, but it needed impeccable execution, and Yakub did a great job here, reports say..
@anandverite Give u r tribute to Yakub by watching the movie Black Friday 10 times :)
At 12:00 AM - Hey Yakub, Happy birthday... May God give you a long life   *awkward silence*
I don't have Faith on  constitution.Sorry to Yakub's family.. May God bless Yakub's soul with rest and peace in heaven.Hang rapist first..

That nigga Zayn may have twitter balls but he's still a soft nigga in my book
Well with Zayn joining ISIS it is hard to maintain their family friendly image. https://t.co/ObzEtFCpPg
Well, now that I think of it I'm gonna sleep and watch it on youtube tomorrow or something, Zayn's not worth my extreme  fatigue anymore
What was the need to @ ZAYN? How thirsty are you bitch? https://t.co/7Xd4lO3Zzx

@illamaunati Zayn is a star! he never tried to steal the spotlight, but he is like a sun, he can't be overshadowed. The public is with him!
@zaynfleek he has been happy ever since he sat next to Zayn at the Louis Vuitton fashion show (':

@zjmcartoon You started with tweeting 'who cares' and this is so stupid bc i bet when Zayn will show us his 1st song/video you will care +
A day without Zayn is like a year without sun https://t.co/vjZHNAAntr
At the Chicago concert on June 2, Liam and Zayn ripped off Harry's shirt in the middle of his WMYB solo. It was a beautiful moment.
But this is Wednesday something should happen with Zayn!  @zaynmalik make something happen, were dying here
Convinced my sister that Zayn will appear in the background of the #DragMeDownMusicVideo  if she watches it 20+ times This is her 6th view
Everybody gets happy around Zayn. People get happy, puppies get happy, the sun gets brighter, the nature gets more beautiful
Excited for the 5th album and Zayn's album #MTVHottest One Direction
Excuse me but when did the march ended? i still rememberyself laughing when zayn left i want the old days back

Harry is so cute and I love them all and I love DMD but I can't help crying watching #DragMeDownMusicVideo the 1st time bc Zayn's not there.
Holy fuck if i meet Zayn on Sunday I'm just not gonna do anything for the rest of my life.
However, I may or may not have shed a tear since it was the first video without Zayn #DragMeDownMusicVideo @onedirection
I am still yet to see Zayn's full fledged smile with his tongue between his teeth after March :( #ZquadWantsZaynToSmile
I can't wait for Zayn tomorrow when he just attend the VMAS it's going to be fire.
I got a solo DM with Zayn in July- I missed him in LA in August- He follows me 2 days later- He unRTed my art- My account is gone. Wonderful
I guess Zayn is going to be at the VMA's tomorrow and I gotta go to bed so I can prepare myself. ZAYN WILL BE ON MY TV AGHH!!
I had a dream I talked to zayn and harry, we were at the concert &amp; zayn was there to see the boys, then harry sat on my lap and danced WHAT
I had my eyes closed already to go to sleep. but I always check a notif to see if it's Zayn and well https://t.co/zZKHkfnMKI
I just sat here, watching videos of Zayn. I never realized that I miss him this much.
I love how the video came out august 21st. Zayn is always making his presence known.
I may have been mad for a day,but I'm so proud of Zayn now
I swear if Zayn performs tomorrow  at the vmas I am not prepared mentally or physically
I sweeeaaaaarrrrr if Zayn is on the red carpet tomorrow at the vma's I'm gonna jump out my fucking window
I'M SO SERIOUS. January is 5 months away so I thought everyone was talking about Zayn's birthday. https://t.co/9OyV9MZJoE
I'm going to bed knowing that there is a possibility that I may wake up to videos and pictures of Zayn performing at the VMA's
I'm not 100% sure but if everything goes like it always does, something is gonna happen with zayn tomorrow, preferably zayn drops a single.
I'm only excited for the VMAs because Zayn may go, if he doesn't I'll cry
I'm really just wondering if this would've happened if Zayn was still in the group https://t.co/nLfHAjrndc
Im just so happy that Zayn is fully living his thotty dteams on this Tuesday morning. Also my hamgover is mild. #Blessed
It's Sunday but zayn's performance makes me want to pop off
It's hard to see Zayn up there bc he look like the sun #zayngetofftheroof
Liam was the 2nd best singer of 1D when Zayn was in 1D.... now he is #1 and Harry is on 2nd spot.  https://t.co/bqCcT0Y7pO
Mar 25 to Aug 25 zquad faced many problems,got hate,zroughts. Still this fam always stood up for Zayn. Proud. Pass it on
Me when the boys' 5th album and Zayn's album comes out  #DragMeDownPower

Oh my god the video is out tomorrow THE FIRST VIDEO AFTER ZAYN LEFT ONE DIRECTION IS OUT TOMORROW DIG A HOLE AND THROW ME IN THERE
Oooh i have a date with Zayn tomorrow
Rumors: Zayn may will give awards on the VMA's and 1 of them could be for the the boys!  I hope it's real!
Stephen Hawking said "This girl may like to know that in another possible universe, she and Zayn are happily married."
Still waiting for the day I wake up to Zayn still being in the band and realising everything after March 25th was just a dream
The boys have this Christmas concert in San Jose in Dec. that I might go to...I feel like Zayn will be back in the band by then
They are absolutely blind to Zayn's good nature. Use lame excuses to hate on him bc they just bitter still.  https://t.co/b7iDCP3NTi
This is a lovely post about Zayn for those who still have issues with him. May make you consider things differently. http://t.co/WNEwQSn9as
Time for bed! Hope it rains tomorrow.... And wake up to a Harry, Niall, Liam, Louis and Zayn follow #MTVHottest One Direction
To me, Zayn vs Neville last December was the definitive wrestling match, after tonight it's Bailey vs Sasha. High spots, false finishes..
Tomorrow at school I'm just going to think of Zayn's selfies so my day will be less terrible
Vote for Zayn under the Most Inspirational UK Asian category by tweeting:   #AUKTop20 @AsiansUK @zaynmalik  Voting ends on September 15th!

When DMD MV will be released tomorrow, but then you realize it's the 1st MV without ZAYN. #DragMeDownMusicVideo http://t.co/Ff5N4nQyjw
Why does everyone ignore Zayn's interview with the Sun? He said all he did was for the fans #5monthswithoutzayn
With school starting tomorrow I'm gonna be missing out on so much with Zayn this makes me so sad
Yeah ,, I was a bit sad bc it was my 1st 1D concert and Zayn wasnt there but I still enjoyed it  https://t.co/HzNAdBPzfF
You would think being the first Music Video without Zayn, it may not do so well, but in reality it's freaking awesome #DragMeDownMusicVideo
Zayn dedicated his 1st solo award to the boys &amp; the boys' to Zayn :")  #5monthswithoutzayn #MTVHottest One Direction http://t.co/pZY7z9tfct
Zayn deserves so much to be happy. I'd trade the moon for the sun if that could make him happy
Zayn is my 5th most played artist. I just wanted to clarify this b4 I'm accused of bandwagoning when he blows up
Zayn is the only reason that I might watch the VMAs tomorrow
Zayn may be an asshole but he's cute and nice deep inside
Zayn may have left the band but i will still support him no matter what cs hes still the 1D zayn i love and i always will
Zayn reminds me of Rih. This may be blasphemous to say but I feel like he's about to be a male version of her which is good
Zayn still looks ethereal, the world is still revolving, the sun still shines bright. Nobody cares :) https://t.co/Wdvp0rgUY6
Zayn was like c'mon then c'mon putting his head close to me like when you're going to have a fight then he just leaned forward &amp; kissed me
Zayn's departure marked the beginning of the end... #RIP #youwillbemissed #1D https://t.co/av4JzrBNNB
Zayn's roller coaster is the most emotional of all emotional roller coasters https://t.co/Z5pTo3uoY6
Zayn's smile is brighter than the shinning sun His eyes are brighter than the shinning stars And his personality as calm as the moonlight
Zayn, i just wanna see you winning grammy on this very first debute album. C'mon, just introduce a new genre of music called Zop or Zquadom.
Zayn: ha ha I love Philly ! Going to make appearance tomorrow .. I love pears :) x
anyone has a solo dm with Zayn bc i dont have one yet since march :( ugh pleaseee :--( just one solo dm... ill give u 1 liam solo dm :)
cheesy as it may sound, I will never be able to thank One Direction (with Zayn) enough for everything they've done &amp; how they saved my life.
do you ever just cry on a daily basis bc of how fat and ugly u are and the fact that u may never meet niall harry louis liam and zayn hurts
harry today im alone at home, and tomorrow night is zayn's birthday.i want to make sure that he will notice me.
hopefully Zayn will tweet something tomorrow so I will be hydrated the crops will be watered children fed skin clear FINGERS CROSSED
i just don't wanna miss anything it sucks waking up and realising that Zayn came back to 1D and the 5th album is out.
i'm just gonna have to find a video/audio of zayn's performance tomorrow
i'm not believing anything until i see zayn's fine ass on the red carpet tomorrow night
im not gonna cry tomorrow i will try not to cry tomorrow bc zayn's happy now and if he's happy then im happy
im too young to die i haven't even met Zayn but then again the internet b lying sigh https://t.co/OG4TxrVmWV
in my dream last night Zayn came and sat down next to me at one direction's concert and I like gave him dirty looks the whole time
listening to the weeknd on the radio and telling mom I want to see in December and she says "this is the Zayn guy right?"
me: c'mon Izz, Zayn isn't performing with the weeknd. Good things like that never happen.
my #OTRAToronto seats were in the section where ZAYN sat for most of WWA . if i had been there last yr i wouldnt be alive to tweet this
on january 1st i said this was going to be zayn's year but i had no idea
on the 25th of march can we celebrate zayn's time in the band and create cute hashtags and post funny things and really cute things pls
tomorrow I've to wake up  early so Zayn's erformance on VMA better be true otherwise u'll regret for playing with my emotions and sleep
with Zayn gone I can now definitively say that Louis is my favorite member of 1D. Harry a distant 2nd.
yo don't ever say that! god forbid! may it not happen! Zayn is cool...don't even try to compare them...i love zaynnn https://t.co/iP8inkZMmG
you may call me a bad fan but I sobbed so hard tonight because Zayn wasn't there. Everytime they sang his part, my heart broke
zayn's voice: c'mon guys you can do it, nobody can drag you down.   #DragMeDownMusicVideo http://t.co/tDkBspxFHs

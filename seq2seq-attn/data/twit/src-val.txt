Well, after more than 2 years I just got a copyright notice from Nintendo on my 2nd oldest video. The culprit? The Wind Waker's main theme.
@Beemercanada Let's make him more likely to be confirmed  #Isaac4Smash #Isaac4Smash! #ISAAC4SMASH! C'mon, Nintendo, this is our childhoods!
@Bendilin @TheFrenchCritic With Nintendo's policy on their flagship exclusives? There are better odds of the sun going supernova in 10 secs.
1st party Nintendo games stay stupidly expensive. Why is Mario Party 9 still $44.99 most places? Definitely not the "QUALITY" of the titles.
@DanteReborn I honestly think the Super Mario Bros 2 set is coming.  Nintendo wanted to concentrate development on the more-similar sets 1st

On 2nd thought, the NX rumors don't completely make sense because Nintendo is already planning smartphone games
@jrconway3 @BitnerdGX Sure, it may not be in a direct sense. But Nintendo gives GX the support by sending them coverage and press releases.
I admit Nintendo may have gone a bit overboard with the whole "lets give all the popular youtubers a copy of super mario maker" thing
@xchadillacx it comes out NOV 13 if it does come out.  Nintendo is notorious for rumors trust me ha
I find it interesting that 3rd party collector's edition don't sell out. Nintendo is a different story.
Just updated my profile to help promote the new game for the Nintendo 3DS coming out on September 25 called Animal Crossing Happy Homes!
i dont know is that the nintendo direct tomorrow is probably when were going to get right
@Warpjump @NinBendo1 At least it established that Nintendo can put in 3rd party characters. (I want Snake back)
Tomorrow's Nintendo Know is all done and it's going to be a pretty good time. http://t.co/WxAxUzhgcy
There is a certain cult classic game, the 3rd in its series, that we have been waiting for in the US but Nintendo refuses to release it
Honestly, lack of 3rd party support should have been expected. its not the company's fault for not siding with Nintendo
@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol
@16KTS @Flareonys Nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.
On November 18th 1998, Nintendo released the Game Boy Color. The first handheld allowed to be owned by POC. #BullshitHistory

@Gary_BBGames Where did you order it from? Tell me it was the Nintendo store so I can hope it turns up tomorrow.
My long shot dream announcement tomorrow from Apple: Apple TV video games include a partnership with Nintendo.
@BlazeRuler Nintendo may have wanted to make it E10+, so they left him out. I dunno, probably not true
@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy
Apparently Super Mario Maker comes out on the 11th of September. I guess it's Nintendo's way of saying "just bloody rebuild them already".
What if tomorrow Apple is just like, "the Apple TV is now a game console and we're going to take on Sony and Microsoft (and Nintendo)" lol.
@wanlov may your everyday look like bonus points you get while playing one of those Nintendo game of Super Mario

Triple H was never Ric Flair's bitch, but Sunday Cena will make Rollins his.   Wow #RAW
Rollins you better win on sunday at #Summerslam! I do not want Super Cena to tie Ric Flair's 16-Time World Title reigns. #Raw #TitleForTitle
I can't watch Monday Night Raw anymore. I miss the Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, Eddie Guerrero &amp; the Hardy Brothers!
You may break the record, but you're no Ric Flair, Mr Cena
Imma cry if Cena win the WWE Title this Sunday. There is no way he should tie Ric Flair's record for most world title reigns
If Cena ties Ric Flair's 16th World Titles, that will truly be a slap in the face of Flair. Ridiculous #RAW
*whispers* Ric Flair is at least a seventeen time World Champion. John Cena won't tie him if he wins on Sunday.
@DecorousVictor Oh are you so sweet to me? Ready to tie Ric Flair this Sunday?
#John Cena - WWE Universe Tripple H was never Ric flair's bitch.... this sun I will make u mine hehehehe cant wait for #Summerslam

I hope that when @RonFunches wins @midnight for the 16th time, Ric Flair comes out to congratulate him. Unless Jon Stewart interferes.
I just took a Coach Freeze clip out of the new @HeadtoHeadRadio intro, to make room for Ric Flair. I love my job. New intro debuts tomorrow!
@LaurenceWHolmes What do you mean, Laurence? The Dudleys, Ric Flair, and Sting were on Raw Monday. Taker wrestled Sunday. It IS the 90s.
If @MsCharlotteWWE defeats Nikki Bella at #nightofchampions, it Should be similar to how Ric Flair beat Dusty Rhodes to win his 1st title
Maybe the 2nd Monster was a bad idea in hindsight. Feel more amped up than Ric Flair on speed.
22 years ago I saw Ric Flair wrestle at age 3, in the very building I'll see @MsCharlotteWWE wrestle in tomorrow night. Mindblowing!!
@PocketVolcano I take it you heard Ric Flair is at Dreamwave in Jan 1/2/16

Rick Perry may be the first to drop out. Out of money.  http://t.co/zwmnwXbH0J #GOP2016
I think a big part of Rick Perry's fall is simply that he is not a sitting governor this time around. May be Jeb's downfall too.
Rick Perry may have to drop out of the race, before one vote is cast, because he has run out of money. I have mixed feelings about that.
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump -How could anyone (Other than Megyn Kelly) compare Rick Perry with Trump? C'mon. Perry is a joke.
May be Rick Perry wishes he would have answered question he was asked 5 times in 24 hours on fox what would u do with 11 million illegals?
Rick Perry said he was the Zar of stopping illegals sat there and glossed himself for 2 months how he could secure the border not 1 idea11 m

@littlebytesnews I never said it is. But the SCOTUS ruled that the 14th Amendment requires a state to license a marriage of same sex couples
@politibunny @brakinggnus @dangoddu @jbryant710 SCOTUS violated the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution not allowing #KimDavis #1A right
@israel4911 @Letha_Hughes It was the 14th that SCOTUS ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. News not your strong subject.
@GuyScott33 14TH AMENDMENT guarantees EQUAL PROTECTION so yeah. Oh &amp;, P.S., no, SCOTUS didn't write the law but DID correctly interpret it.
@LeeAdams_4Him purpose of the SCOTUS is to establish constitutionality of laws. they ruled that gay marriage bans violated 14th amend rights
@A10Jim @ninaland @WoodhullSFA And that's why SCOTUS has the last word on what laws states may enact and enforce. Hence "Supreme Court."
.@tonyortegamusic @MagDods @rachelheldevans SCOTUS ruled that the 14th amendment applies to same sex marriage.
The SCOTUS claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling. No matter how far you stretch it isn't there.
@Billd111 @megynkelly @tedcruz SCOTUS has determined that the 14th amendment guarantees equal access to marriage for all citizens
@SniffJenkum SCOTUS has no authority to make law. Only Congress may legislate. #SeparationOfPowers #AbuseOfPower
@cspanwj In their recent pro gay marriage decision, SCOTUS has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the United States Constitution.
Clerk #KimDavis is jailed because SCOTUS can see Gay Marriage in the 14th Amend. but Fed.Dist.Judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st.

Huckabee claims SCOTUS made new law on SSM. No. The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment is more than a century old.

Ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if SCOTUS now writes law, guess Ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.

Thursday night Must-See TV hasn't been this comical since the Friends &amp; Seinfeld one-two punch. #GOPDebate
@Morning_Joe I haven't laughed this hard on a Thur night since Seinfeld ended. Not the last episode though, that one was terrible.
What's with this Twitter account? It's like the Seinfeld episode where they talk about themselves in the 3rd person. https://t.co/jlQIzMGtZR
Happy 60th birthday actor Wayne Knight / In Seinfeld and Third Rock from the Sun, you may sight.

Nothing like watching episodes of Seinfeld on a Sunday morning.Seen all but the humorous slant is different each time. Magic @JerrySeinfeld
Just got 4 tickets to see Seinfeld next Friday. Fuck with me.
"go back in your shell, go back in your shell!" LMAO, Dora's dancing might be the new Elaine dancing on Seinfeld!   https://t.co/cChiMDBVkI
All I see is the Seinfeld logo.  https://t.co/vtIOqt0oVV

Rewind Wednesday - Did you know that there were Nintendo and Super Nintendo games in Seinfeld's apartment? http://t.co/2z4dVizZQV
Keith Hernandez on Seinfeld was the best appearance by an athlete on any TV show or movie. 2nd is Mark McGuire on Mad About You.
Plus I got Seinfeld all on DVD Plus I killed the math section on the SAT
I told someone about how I once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched Seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me.
Sun took away my energy  I want some cold pressed juice and I wanna watch Seinfeld at home
TBS playing "The Comeback" episode of Seinfeld (again). Should I bust out the Jerk Store line in tomorrow night's debate?
About to watch about 15 episodes of Seinfeld till work is over, fuck 3rd shift
@lupeo1219 well Seinfeld is like the sun of comedies. :p
Awesome day in Central Park. Looking forward to Seinfeld tour and then NXT Takeover Brooklyn tomorrow  #NXTTakeOverBrooklyn #NXTBrooklyn
To quote Seinfeld's Kramer, Monday has a feel; Wed has a feel, and FRIDAY has a feel. Here's to feeling the first Friday of the school year!
Popcorn and Seinfeld sounds like the perfect friday night... #ithinkimgettingold
Someone needs to make a Video Compilation of all the SAT vocabulary Cosmo Kramer spontaneously uses on Seinfeld
Will watch old movies, Seinfeld and other silly things till Sunday...the old #katrina news footage is too much for this heart to bear.
This may be hard to believe: I am watching Seinfeld's "The Contest" for the very first time.
Netflix and Hulu stats - Seinfeld still killing it; http://t.co/LFSSjxwsAK
I just bought tickets to see Seinfeld in Durham next month. What a great Tuesday!
Stay up late, watch Seinfeld, make Steve drive tomorrow.
Which on its surface may seem counterintuitive, but the marginal utility of Seinfeld obviously increases at an increasing rate.
Love that Seinfeld episode in the picture https://t.co/BzTPPLzAeB
George's stories may be my favorite thing about Seinfeld - he is so passionate it's wonderful
.@ZachLowe_NBA the Blazers have been cemented as my new 2nd-fave team based solely on how much of a Seinfeld fan Neil Olshey is. #cartwright
World, I think it may be time to accept that nothing Larry David did after Seinfeld has been funny.
I'm finding my life and the dialogue around me are right out of a Seinfeld episode. Many of you may think this is fun, but it's unnerving.
@starbex Or something like NBC's "Blackout Thursday" where they had the lights come back on at 9pm because Seinfeld refused to participate.
Won't be live tweeting the vma's tonight despite what you may have guessed. Watching Seinfeld instead. Thank you.
@KaineofTermina So that's a yes and a maybe for this reference. I'm not sure if anyone got the Seinfeld reference Wednesday.
"The Magic Loogie" is one of the cleverest scenes from Seinfeld ever. For your Tuesday evening pleasure, https://t.co/KAJfAoty1t.
This may be the greatest thing I've seen in awhile, just because Seinfeld is the greatest show  https://t.co/sR0bol8sFv
Seinfeld may be the only thing I care about anymore

@jacktame Given your love of Kanye and my love of Seinfeld, I think you may dig this. https://t.co/uyGJAf4UCh
Seinfeld's "the contest" may just be one of the best episodes ... #andthenthereweretwo
@kanani_lol what a waste. It even has the last man on earth, Seinfeld, South Park and Monday night raw. Hulu is awesome
@NACHO2813 @Joe_Schmucc But he is shirking the gap between him and Eddie year by year. No one is catching Seinfeld, but he may catch Eddie.
@morganameridius @disquietus now back in the day I watched a good bit. Friends, Seinfeld, 3rd Rock, 70s show. But as I got older not much
Little brother just asked me if I'm down to binge watch Seinfeld...there goes my Sunday night lolol.
So like, he missed Seinfeld and Friends? And to think I was really starting to like this dude.  https://t.co/sxS4SGOGSk
@TheBestMicah Hulu you say? This and Seinfeld alone may be worth reactivating my subscription
@sigridellis I may have read that in the way that Seinfeld greeted Newman.
@ColinCowherd @Mi_Crawford   I also thought Seinfeld episode for the hair but I'm going with 6th grade class photo.
@sethhinz haha! Seriously, though, it reminds me of the Seinfeld character Jimmy. "Jimmy liked worship this Sunday."  #chsocm
@Seinfeld2000 something has been bugging me lately. What if Seinfeld was current day? What if brand new episodes came out every Thursday?
Interested to see what kind of ratings the U.S. Open final gets on Saturday with Serena presumably going for history up against CFB.
I'm pretty sure Serena ripped that match winning ace the same time USMNT game up their 3rd.
And with Serena's 11th ace she wins the match vs her sister Venus
History still in the making with Serena's win over sister Venus! #GrandSlam https://t.co/p56xxav8vv
I love my Nike players!! Way to go Serena! Expecting great things from you tomorrow, federer!
Serena just needs to win two more matches to win the last 5 majors/4 in a single year/last 4 us opens https://t.co/dwz4tM0HBN
Serena reaches her 7th semifinals of the #USOpen in a row. Two more matches to complete the Grand Slam.
@hbryant42 Venus missed so many neutral shots in 3rd set that she never let Serena feel the pressure; she let her off the hook, in a way.
One of the most beautiful moments in tennis history! Nice hug! Serena defeats Venus in their 27th face-to-face... http://t.co/GPtPn3SWvO
Serena won, but big sister Venus gave her the flux! Congrats to both of them for giving us a great tennis match. https://t.co/brJ29dzm2X
In the 5th meeting of the sisters at the US Open, Serena defeats Venus to advance to the semis http://t.co/sk3S7lteui http://t.co/u2savhbyHw
@jon_wertheim @BenRothenberg It played out like Serena took off the 2nd set. An in form Vika MIGHT make her pay. Might.
Dem born Venus come born Serena on top. Blessings on Blessings on Blessings.... May our children always excel and make us proud #USOpen
Happy for Serena. I want her to win the 22nd GS, tie Steffi and win the CYGS. @usopen #usopen
I hope every young girl watched the Williams sisters tonight. Serena may have won but they'll go down as the greatest sibling duo ever!
Serena is emotionally drained. Hope she has time to rest up before Thursday.
Answer: Moi. Question: Who's seeing Serena play in the semifinals on Thursday?
Serena be lettin oponents comeback in the 2nd set just to make the media feel better. That good #SerenaVsVenus
Sisterly love: After beating older sis Venus in 3rd set match at @usopen, Serena says, "She's the best person I know." (Cc:@alexa_pollock)
What's weird is Serena and Venus are a train ride away right now but I feel like they are goddesses who live on the sun
Serena may have taken that match, but Venus wins.  So much class.  Just a good person. The same cannot be said about her sister.  #veealways
"@SportsCenter: Serena remains on top! The younger Williams bts Venus in the sisters' 14th GS matchup, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. http://t.co/Bl2LdYsQ9c
I'm man enough to admit that I proudly couldn't handle Serena's back shot. Babygirl may have the skrongest thigh/a$$ muscles in the world
Can't take disrespect ppl show Venus! She's the 2nd best in women's draw-wins a set off Serena &amp; ppl say it's fixed. Such BS #SerenavsVenus
Serena won. The Cubs are winning in St. Louis. I'm enjoying sports lately. Too bad the Bears play this Sunday.

@ArleneNKelly and you will be procrastinating to see Serena make history on sunday?
Serena dominated in the end, a tough match for the win! https://t.co/QHjXSFz4Bi
Know what's scary? Serena was mildly injured a little after Wimbledon and sat out before the US Open.  She could win with that formula.
@NerdyWonka @terri_georgia My feeling Serena could win 2 straight set, but as a respect2 Venus and viewers she let Venus 2win 2nd set
Now that I've calmed down after watching Serena.... Do you realize how great tomorrow's Vika-Simona match is gonna be??

@nytimes Bitter /Sweet - Serena may almost not have wanted to win. BUT - their  father Richard always taught them, to do the best they can.
Couldn't hang on to stay up and watch 3rd set but it was nice to see Serena beat Venus. What a resilient, tough player Venus is, tho.
@katetscott Best moment on air Tue.: GR " you look down on me because I don't smoke. KS "Yeah" "C'mon Gary you and me 420 and watch Serena"
